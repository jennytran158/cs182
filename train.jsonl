{"review_id": "6_3", "text": "Yesterday around 3:30 pm I was driving west on Pinnacle Reak Rd just east of Cave Creek Rd. Some distracted driver in a white pick up truck veered completely into my lane and was coming head on at me. I hit the horn and jerked my minivan off the road on the right side. There is no shoulder there, just a large patch or deep sand from years of storm run off. My right side tires hit the sand and as my van careened forward it went up on two wheels. There was a pole, maybe a speed limit sign, right where I was headed. I truly thought I was going to die. Instead of my life passing before my eyes I had one clear thought in my head. \"Thank you god that my kids are not in the van\". \nBy the grace of god my right wheels sunk deep into the sand and my van fell back down in the upright position. I sat there stunned with sand swirling around my car and fear shreiking through my mind. Glancing up, in my rear view mirror was the distant speck of a white pick up truck. \nThis is where one would rant and rave about distracted drivers but we all know that they will read many things as they drive, but this post won't be one of them. I would rather tell you what happened next. \nI tried calling AAA and as I sat on hold many people drove past offering me nasty looks and a few drive by comments about what a bad location I choose to pull off the road. Finally a kind soul helped me get my van out of the sand pit. Bless you kind soul! \nThat was not my last kind rescuer. Nervously, I got my car back on the road. Too afraid to u turn I got on cave creek road headed south. About half a mile down I spotted a Valvoline and turned in. To my surprise a young lady came out to greet me. I told her through tears and gulping snot bubble sobs what happened and asked if they could check under my car because I was afraid to drive it. Kiara was so kind. She grabbed water for me and put my car in the front of the line and into a bay immediately. Then Alfred came, brought me tissues and reassurances. He checked under the car and for the most part it was all intact. The same could not be said for me. I was too frighten to pull my car out of the bay so after changing my oil Alfred pulled my car out and turned me around. The lovely young woman that cared for me as I pulled into Valvoline is the daughter of the kind man who got me back on the road. \nI hope if you have read this far into my post, that you might be a little more careful driving, but I also hope you might also be mindful when choosing where to give your car business. I hope you will care to give your business to someone who cares so much about their customers. Alfred & Kiara Yarbrough Valvoline 21037 N. Cave Creek road.\nThank you,\nDara", "stars": 5.0}

I have traveled around & lived in various parts of this great town and I can say that when you put a team in place that is dedicated to making the most of every experience and upholding ALL the rules for EVERYONE not everyone is going to be happy.  That being said, I also find it interesting that NONE of the negative comments even suggest any stretching of the truth of the \"so-called victims\".  There are some hanis management & apartments in this town PRELUDE is NOT one of them. I've never seen the need for armed guard security, I've never had an issue; when properly submitting an issue, to management. I have seen people go bat-crazy left and threaten personal violence because they were called on their treatment of staff or just didn't like having to follow the rules.

SimonMed was still waiting for the Authorization from my Insurance Company so my first Appointment scheduled had to be cancelled 3 days before. Needing to have my MRI & X-Ray done soon, was very important due to the Health Issue I was dealing with. I called my Ins Company to find out why my MRI & X-Ray order was still not approved. After being placed on hold and being transferred to different Departments, I decided to end the call. \nAt that point I made de decision to call SimonMed Imaging in hopes that someone there could help me. After explaining the situation to the Rep, she decided to transfer me to someone that could potentially help me. The new Rep was Sonia, and she was already briefed about my dilemma. After checking a few things in my file, she decided to call my Insurance Co. She placed me on a brief hold. Then she came back on the line to tell me that she was trying to get the approval but that now she was being transferred to one of the Doctors in charge of approving orders. Shortly after Sonia came back on the line to tell me that that she was able to obtained the approval. Knowing that time was of the essence, Sonia transferred me to her Manager named Corrie to help me get scheduled ASAP! Corrie spoke to one of her schedulers named Alex and they were able to find me a spot the next day. Please keep in mind, it usually takes a week in advance to find a spot since there are a lot of people already scheduled before. I can't say enough about how thoughtful, kind, and willing to help were the individuals I mentioned above, including the 1st Rep. that took my call. The reality as we know well, is that this example doesn't happen very often. SimonMed Imaging deserves a lot of credit for hiring and promoting individuals like them. I will never forget this. This is another example that shows to all of us, that when we are in situations of desperately needing help, that there are still good individuals like them in this world. \nThank you again to SimonMed Imaging and the individuals that helped me.

{"review_id": "6_9", "text": "Let me pre-empt this review by stating that my standards for home repair are extremely high. I dont usually call electricians, landscapers, drywallers, painters, framers, roofers, plumbers, or mechanics because I can usually do it myself, or figure it out for more than half the cost of a pro. So needless to say that if I do call in a pro, it had better be up to my standards the way I would expect ME to do it. I will nitpick the heck out of anything that is done in my house. Now on to the review:\n\nI knew my AC was going out...for the 3rd time. It was only a matter of when. Cheap contractor grade AC in cookie cutter home, I expected it, and knew it was coming. Wahl Air Conditioning from the beginning was superb in customer service. My AC went out in my house this last Sunday night, so I called them first thing Monday morning. They said they could be out first thing later that morning to give me a quote. Being the responsible person that I am also called 2 other AC guys. One big name brand, the other another small guy. The big guys couldnt be bothered to see me until Wed. and the other small guy said he could be here that morning as well. The small company got here first and quoted me over 9700 for a new cadillac unit from American Standard. Ouch! They left and Wahl came in. They came in at 8700 for the same unit, but told me about the $1k rebate American standard offered, and that brought the price down to $7700 and Wahl was going to go the extra mile and fix a problem room I had, install a new intake grate, non of which the other company was going to do. And then to add icing on the cake, they rolled in a portable AC unit and told me how to block off a section of the house with sheets or plastic sheeting and the portable could keep that part of the house cool while they went to work. Nobody else offered that! I had visions of moving the family to a hotel or my brothers house until the work was done! They said they could begin work on Wed. Sold. They came Wed right at 8am and told me it would be a one day job. Awesome. They put sheets down on the floor where they had to traffic back and forth to access the air handler in the attic through my daughter's room, and were extremely polite, even asking permission before using a bathroom, or plugging tools into my outlets for power. They had to take the trim off the access door to the ceiling space and I was curious what kind of job they would do putting it back since these are AC guys, and not finishing carpenters. So the day ends, and lo and behold as they are charging the system they find a hole in the coil that the manufacturer had inadvertently created. It was evening by now, and they couldnt get a new unit until the morning, but for my troubles the offered to extend my 1 year warranty for labor up to 10 years to match the parts warranty. Small gamble on their part since I purchased a very well made unit, but it was more than I would have asked for because at this point you just have to suck it up and it gets done when it gets done. As it was the portable unit they lent me was doing just fine. They came the next morning and installed the new unit, charged it up,  and I had new AC by 10am Thur morning. I went and inspected everything and its beautiful. Even the trim work they tor down I cant even tell they removed it, new caulking on the seams and everything. Im in awe of the quality these guys presented for the price they charged. I found my new AC guys.\n\nThe only con I can give them is that they dont accept Amex. Only Visa/MC, or a check. So be prepared because I wasnt. But that is my fault for not asking :P", "stars": 5.0}

Called AAA, spent 40 mins on the phone with them (24 of which were on hold) so I was really exhausted. AAA sent a locksmith who was able to unlock my car door. However the trunk release button in the car was not working, my car does not have a lock on the outside of the trunk to pick/unlock w a key (its opened with a remote).... therefore we were stuck. The locksmith and I were lost not knowing what the next step would be... I couldnt just get another microchip key made on the spot b/c it wouldn't help me get into my trunk (since there is no key hole outside the trunk). Called Infiniti dealer who quoted me $230 for a new remote and to program it  Then while the locksmith was putting my car alarm together since he reset it breaking in. I remembered Euro Asian Motorworks b/c I had previously book marked them on yelp having seen so many of their advertisements in my penny saver/value paks (?). I did it b/c ive had so complicated car troubles in the past that so many other places couldnt figure out so since i saw their ads I just bookmarked them for future needs. I called them curiously asking how much to purchase/program a new remote. DJ answered, told him what was going on and why I needed a new remote, he pulled up my car make and told me that there is a trunk release red strap b/w my back seats and that I can access the trunk that way. I tried it, couldnt find it, the locksmith tried it and we were able to get into the trunk and popped it open that way!!! SUCCESS!! DJ was very patient during the conversation b/c I mustve been very stressed out. He walked me through it quickly and saved me $225 w/ the locksmith from having to make a new key/buying a new remote. He also advised me that only a dealership can sell me the key since it would be illegal to do so otherwise. \n\nI was sooo thrilled that it worked out! He answered my questions and helped me out w/o having been there customer. I will definitely bring my car there in the future. So glad they could helpme out with just a call.

{"review_id": "6_12", "text": "Backstory: My 2012 Sonata has had a problem for several months. At first it was really minor, just a slight knocking that sounded like a small stone or acorn bouncing around under the hood, so I let it go for a while just assuming the stone or whatever it was would tumble out eventually. But it slowly got worse. I took the vehicle in to a different dealer in Scottsdale a couple of months ago and got my 60k service done. The sound didn't go away, and things got worse with my car. The engine started stuttering/hesitating at high acceleration. And then at max acceleration, I would get high revs but the torque would bottom out completely and white smoke would pour out the back of the car for a second or two until the engine finally \"caught\" and accelerated. Three weeks ago I took it back to that same dealer, who for the moment shall remain nameless, and they could find NOTHING wrong with the engine! I found this hard to believe. I even authorized a tech of theirs to drive my car home and back with all their sensors hooked up to the engine. They apologised and returned it to me the next day saying they could find nothing wrong!!\n\nI drove it for a couple of weeks and it got worse and worse. I could hear something \"tumbling\" even when coasting, it was silent during coasting before. So in desperation I brought it to my old service yard and rep, Craig at Larry Miller Hyundai. Craig accepted the car the next day and called to tell me that they could definitely hear the sound and noted the problem. After doing a teardown, pulling out the oilpan etc, they found that the engine was basically disintegrating. Craig called me in and showed me photos a tech had taken. The oil pan looked like someone had been panning for gold with it, basically shiny metal debris all over the place from the engine ball bearings. The entire thing could have shat itself while I was on the highway, blown up or god knows what else.\n\nA check with Hyundai HQ indicated that the issue was covered under warranty, AND Larry Miller are footing the bill for a great loaner car replacement while I wait for my engine to be replaced. I'm on a transplant list right now, it could take several weeks for a replacement engine. But the new car is even more comfortable than my Sonata, so I'm good with that.\n\nBasically, excellent service from LM Peoria, and Craig Mathias is an absolute legend to work with, calls you and keeps you informed every step of the way. Hands down five stars across the board.", "stars": 5.0}
{"review_id": "6_13", "text": "This review deserves a bit of background info. I have a Stuhrling watch with a kinetic watch winder (a little weight in the back of the watch twists around as you walk around and winds the watch that way). It was a gift from my wife on our first anniversary. I first went to Fast Fix Jewelry & Watch Repairs in Anthem (Eastern and Grand Hills), as they had good reviews. They were very busy, and they told me that I could leave the watch with them and they'd give me an estimate in a few days. I did so, and I wanted nearly two weeks without hearing back. I called them to ask about the estimate, and they put me on hold for a while, and then told me they'd have to call me back. An hour later they called and told me a price, which happened to be as much as it would cost to buy a new version of this watch. I passed.\n\nThen I came to Anthony's Watch & Jewelry Repair (which I believe is now called All Kinds or something like that). I came in, and he was dealing with a customer, he very quickly got to me, immediately took my watch and started taking it apart. He then told me that it should be a relatively easy fix, and he would only charge me $50, but he went on to tell me that it would still wind by hand, so if I didn't want to fix the kinetic weight, I could still use it.\n\nSo, essentially, he quickly helped me, gave me an immediate estimate on the spot, gave me a good rate, and also honestly told me that I didn't need to fix it if I didn't want to.\n\nI got it fixed by him, and it works very well. Excellent customer service, good prices, and good quality of work. I'd recommend this place to anyone.", "stars": 5.0}

It seems like they are making the apartments more upscale and upgrading each units as tenants move out.

They have stated they are under new management, and has made things right with me. \n\n\n\nThis has got to be one of the WORST AC companies in Vegas. Here's my experience:\nThursday AC goes out. Called my landlord to get it fixed. He send out Tech Cool, who cannot come out Friday and closed on weekends. So four days later in over 100 degree heat, tech cool comes out TO DO AN INSPECTION. THEY DID NOT EVEN BRING THE CORRECT TOOLS TO FIX A SIMPLE LEAK. So the technician (Zack) cannot diagnose my unit, do he calls someone who is trying to diagnose over the phone. Zack \"figures it out\" and asks for the $45 fee. I ask if it will fixed today (it was only about 8AM), and he replies with no. Clearly dissatisfied, I pay him and he leaves. The next morning he comes out, and we find out it was diagnosed incorrectly; at least another day until the repair. So finally on Wednesday three vans and a truck come out to my house, and an hour later my AC was fixed, or so I thought. About two months the later, the AC goes out again, on a Wednesday. Tech cool is booked Thursday, so they come out Friday. Zack informs me the job that was done before has failed, and will have to be re-soldered since it has leaked all of the coolant. I ask Zack if he can at least recharge the coolant so that I will have some cold air temporarily. Zack again states that he does not have any coolant in his van, so that is an impossibility. So ANOTHER weekend passes with no AC in the terrible Vegas heat in the middle of the summer. Monday arrives and they seem the do the job right so far. \n\nSo over four trips later (also over $200 in trip charges that were not waived), and I finally have my AC working like it should have been the first time tech cool was sent out.

{"review_id": "6_25", "text": "Our largely trouble free desktop computer running Window XP for the past 12 years was having start up issues. \n\nI brought the computer in and met Matt and described the problem. Matt said it could be the motherboard and/or the drive.\n\nI protested and told him the computer had no inconsistencies on the drive, no malware, no viruses. He replied \"you are talking about psychotherapy and the patient needs a liver transplant.\"\n\nImmediately I appreciated his wry dry humor. \n\nI shared with him a parts build I had put together for a custom computer which we wanted to go forward with in September of 2017. For now we wanted a fix to tide us over until then.\n\nHe warned if it was determined the problem was the motherboard there was no solution for us; he could not get another since ours was 8 generations old; not even an OEM version.\n\nThe next day he called with devastating news. It indeed was the motherboard. He sent via email pictures of four blown capacitors on the board.\n\nAt that point I was very fearful that we would lose all our data despite having it all backed up onto an external Western Digital drive via Acronis.\n\nI shared that our most important desire was to save all personal documents from each of our (my wife and I) respective profiles and twelve years of music on iTunes.\n\nI had just spoken with a support technician at Apple who told me since our version of iTunes was old, the music could not be downloaded into their newest version.\n\nMatt said that would depend on the condition of the hard drive, something he would know after examining it. He determined that the surface of the drive was damaged but the hardware supporting the drive was intact. He observed it was a good thing we brought it in since he surmised there was about seven days use out of it left.\n\nHe did not guarantee he could do what we asked but felt confident he could.\n\nMy parts list totaled $2,900. Matt went over each component and made recommendations for changes. When we were done my parts list was reduced to $2,100. The price reduction did not represent compromised performance; quite the contrary. With the graphics card I had originally listed Matt said it needs to run at 70 to 80 percent of capacity and if I were not using it in that manner I would not see the benefit whereas I would see MORE performance out of a card that cost less but was more accurately matched for intended use; horses for courses, and so it went with each part including the case.\n\nMatts reasoning was so clear it inspired confidence. I pulled my parts from Parts Picker. As I was \"building\" the computer with each addition of a part the site had a pop up that said \"there are no incompatibilities\" and continued to say so until the end. Matt said he did see where based on his experience there could be some parts that did not play well with one another. He agreed that the Corsair Vengeance series that was recommended to me over the higher level Corsair Domination Series was less troublesome.\n\nI told him that my goal was stability and at the same time although we are not gamers, we wanted a machine that was ultra-fast. He did what is called \"active listening\" and recommended a top of the line component that would meet those needs.\n\nHAPPY ENDING. Matt was able to rescue all of our personal documents and our iTunes library put into the latest version; a Miracle and we are so grateful.\n\nI knew he was not using hyperbole when he said \"you will feel as if you have gone from a Model T to the Jetsons.\" Experiencing the truth of what he said was something else entirely.\n\nPer my request he installed the ESET Internet Security software that I purchased and brought to him. He also installed Microsoft Office Home and Business 2016 as well as Windows 10 Home 64 bit.\n\nMatt shared in our excitement and it was palpable. There is something special to be said when someone is excited about building something for you; good energy going into the product.\n\nAll the above is a very long winded way of describing someone who is adept at what he does and at the same time able to communicate what he does effectively, honestly and compassionately; a rare trifecta of skill sets in any business but especially in the world of technology.\n\nThat Matt cared about us as people was evident at every point along the way. By that I mean he did not see us as customers only; someone to add to the profit margin.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Matt IS Madison Geeks. If he went elsewhere we would follow him. Kahlal Cunningham, CEO of Madison Geeks would do well to make Matt a partner. \n\nIf we had not had the conversations we had with Matt and the trust he established with us, a $3,000 custom built computer would never have been built. Had we not had the numerous consultative conversations no work order would have been placed with Madison Geeks; it goes without saying that building a custom computer is not the same as putting money in a candy machine and out comes the candy bar.", "stars": 5.0}

{"review_id": "6_39", "text": "I had the worst situation happen to me when I got a tattoo from Sin City Ink tattoo shop. When I spoke with the tattoo artist I explained my story behind the tattoo and why it was so personal to me. He did the tattoo great and asked me to come back to get a free touch up, so I did. During the touch up I did not look over because I don't like seeing the needle and the whole process because it made me nervous so I stayed on my phone the whole time. After he was done he decided to take it upon himself to add extra unnecessary shading that I never asked for and ruined the tattoo that I wanted as well as took away from the beauty of it. He did not seem to care one bit and made excuses saying that it would make the tattoo look good, even though I never requested him to do any of that. \n\nAfter being so hurt, shocked, and angry I had called the owner to discuss the situation. He offered to fix it and I told him there was no fixing what was done because I didn't want the shading. I also told him that his artist never had me sign any type of consent form before going to have my tattoo done. He asked what I'd like to do and I said I need to have it removed from laser removal and to have the tattoo artist pay for it. He agreed, but several days after that he said it was not his responsibility and to take it up with his artist. I informed the tattoo artist and he didn't seem very willing to take care of it or took it seriously. Not to mention he and owner were very rude in texts and on the phone about the whole situation. \n\nAt this point, I was upset and very outraged that he was not willing to try to fix his own mistake. I called different lawyers' offices for three days straight. Every person I talked to thought the matter was silly, some did not want to take it at all, and others kept trying to refer me to the state bar. I was getting more upset and overwhelmed about the situation and came across Paul Padda's number. I spoke to his legal assistant who was very kind and understanding of the situation. I gave her all my information and was surprised I got called back to come in for a meeting.  I explained to Paul the seriousness of the situation and the meaning of the tattoo and why it was so important. Paul was very sympathetic and so was his team.  They made me feel so relieved and helped made me feel so much better that they would be helping me with the situation. I am so glad I came across his number. He was the only one willing to help and he did more than  just that, with helping me feel comfortable, at ease, and like I was I mattered.

{"review_id": "6_43", "text": "This is a long review, but necessary in order to understand how wonderful East Valley Floors truly is. \nFirst time homeowners here. We made the classic mistake of purchasing expensive, nearly impossible to install [well] 40\" rectified edge porcelain plank tile to replace the drab shag carpet in our 40 year old midcentury modern home. In an attempt to make-up some of the material cost, we skimped on the install and hired an unlicensed individual. We immediately realized our mistake after the first room. The tile was not level, grout lines were all over the map, cuts were poorly made. We were forced to forfeit our deposit and spend the next month on our hands and knees, prying up each tile one-by-one, in order to start again. \nOn our 2nd round, we sought a licensed and bonded contractor (he will remain nameless), who boasted of his 20+ years of tiling experience, and how he'd laid football fields-worth of our precious wood-look tile. We felt confident that we were in good hands and our nightmare would soon be over. To our utter dismay, his work proved to be even worse than the first guy, and he was dismissed after the first room as well. Feeling heartbroken and defeated, we spread a large area rug over his tile job, left the remaining 850sqft of boxed tile on two pallets in the garage, and lived with bare concrete floors and smelly carpet for another year. \nEnter Von and Luis from East Valley Floors - our saving grace and light at the end of the tunnel. After a very positive recommendation from a colleague, we decided to give it one last go. Von, the President of East Valley Floors, met with us on a Saturday, as we were very apprehensive and insisted we both be present. Von listened to our sob-story, measured our rooms, made great suggestions (direction of the tiles, trimming off and laying the tile under the door casings that we plan to replace, etc.) and ensured us his company was up for the task at hand. We were cautiously optimistic at best, but decided to put our trust in Von and signed another contract.\nAbout a week after signing the contract, Luis arrived to install our 4x40\" rectified edge porcelain plank tile. He was prompt, prepared, and very pleasant. First, he used a concrete grinder to grind down and even out high and low spots on our base floors. Then, he utilized leveling system clips (which are not cheap) to ensure all the tiles were level - in addition to the grout spacers. He worked quickly and I'm not sure he ever took a break. He began our install on a Thursday morning, and even worked on Saturday to keep the momentum going. We were instantly impressed by his craftsmanship and ethic. Luis not only did beautiful work, he did it in record time. He briefed us at the start and end of each day, so we always knew what to expect. Luis laid the tile, grouted, and we were moving back into our rooms in under a week. The \"it's too good to be true - I must be dreaming\" feeling lasted for a while before our wonderful new reality sunk in. These really are our gorgeous new floors. We've already started planning our next project with them.", "stars": 5.0}

It's like the mall from the Tim + Eric movie. There was a table of about 8 elderly people all huddled around having some sort of meeting, a pair of Indian chicks having lunch and a downtrodden old short lady sweeping the perfectly clean floor that did not need sweeping. Amazing.\n\nAs I was walking around my footsteps were louder than anything else. No music, no crowd ambiance, nothing. Every store was empty, with employees staring blankly into the void that is employment at this mall. It was phenomenal. The Spencer's Gifts neon grid sign from the 90's was still up. I haven't seen one of those in a decade at least. \n\nI haven't realy seen anything like it before - there is no reason for this place to exist. Who is running it? how is there any money to keep it going? A cell phone kiosk guy tried to desperately get my attention but I was headed for the 21st Century Smoke stand right behind him. \n\nI got my e-liquid and walked around a bit more.

We always had to pay ourselves to replace any appliance that kept needing repair.\nOur central A/C was making a low noise on Monday, I was concerned since I do suffer from a chronic illness that heat really can cause a lot of havoc. AHS has it documented in their records in case this was to happen that I can't be in the heat for any length of time.  I had an appt. and  when we got in our A/C was not working, nothing but hot air was coming out and the house was getting hot.\nWe called AHS, they saw it documented about my illness, so they have 4 hours to locate a vendor, didn't hear back from anyone. Meanwhile I was on the phone looking for a hotel for the night as the house was getting hotter and I was getting sicker.\nWe stayed at Suncoast, and it seemed that AHS didn't do very much to get a vendor that night.\n In the morning, my husband called and Vegas Strong Heating and Cooling was coming in about 10 minutes, the receptionist was just about to call him. Usually when a company comes they never usually have the parts if it can be repaired on the truck, learned this from past experience, so you have to wait again, so my husband told me not to give the room up until he called me with the news. \nSal, from Vegas Strong Heating and Cooling had the fan motor on the truck, he fixed the A/C to our surprise, the first time when dealing with AHS. This was basically our last thing we'd deal with AHS about since they have been a total disappointment in the past. We have our contract with AHS since we own our place, and nothing that was non fixable was ever replaced by them, we had to pay for every appliance that they could not repair.  If it wasn't for Vegas Strong, we would have finally dumped AHS for the way they do business or shall I say, the way they don't do business.\nVegas Strong Heating and Cooling was the first and only company that they ever sent that did the job right away.

After trying multiple medications, the inflammation and disease progressed, the doctor stated that I have to deal with the fact that she will be blind soon. Fast forward a few months, I met another doctor from the Eye Care for Animals clinic in Avondale. She had explained that there are other medications that were more appropriate for my dog. Upon the first visit at the Avondale clinic, we tried the medications and my dogs eyes have improved 80%. She is no longer going blind and has been doing great!

{"review_id": "6_74", "text": "Manscaping.  Yep, That word that most guys do not want to say.  I spent years dealing with this myself.  I would try and convince myself that I was a contortionist, and somehow get all the areas that I cant even see with a mirror.  Every time I attempted this myself, I got cut, burned, humiliated and angry.  That was just from trying to figure out the trimmer attachments.  After letting my body hair get so out of control that it was growing out of my shirt in the back, I knew it was time to go to a professional.  But, what do I even say to this person?  I had a lot of anxiety and to be honest, this is just a very stressful topic for me.  Well, I called Alan and gave him a basic synopsis of what I needed over the phone. Back and chest hair shaved off to start and possibly more.  He was not at all taken back.  He told me his availability and we booked an appointment.  I thought about this all week before the appointment and almost canceled a few times.  I mean, this is kind of a personal thing and I don't know anything about Alan or this salon.  But, I REALLY wanted this body hair taken care of.  I arrived at the salon on time and Alan was at the desk and welcomed me.  There was nobody else there.  He had reserved this time just for me which was comforting.  He asked me what we were doing today and I explained that I wanted back and chest hair shaved off and if he was able to do the \"down under\" areas, that would be great.  He didn't even blink. He said that would be no problem and then he went to prepare this other room that is off the main room of the salon that looks like they do this kind of thing in.  It has some skin machines in there too so it looked like something out of North Scottsdale.  I got on the table and got comfortable. He tried very skillfully to make conversation with me while he was working on me, but I just didn't know what to say.  I was completely relaxed so I wasn't nervous, but while I was laying there, I just kept thinking that this guy has a straight razor so I just wasn't really into chatting.  Sorry Alan.  Seriously though, He worked on me for 2 hours!  I had no idea it would take someone that long to do this work.  Wow, I would have give up after 20 minutes personally.  This is why I hired a professional.  After we were done, we went to the register and he gave me the price.  It was so absolutely affordable that I started wondering why the hell didn't I do this before?  This is what I was saving by doing it myself?  With all that stress and cleanup I would have to deal with???  Holy Smokes.  I went home, and went on with my day. The next day when I was showering after my run, and realized  how smooth by body was, I could not stop feeling great about myself.  Even as I type this, I feel amazing.  THANK YOU Alan!  Thank you so much.  You made me feel at ease, you were a complete professional and I am totally coming back to have this done every 30 days.  But, I am probably still not going to have much to say when I am on the table.", "stars": 5.0}

{"review_id": "6_80", "text": "I only go to Taco Bell late at night when everything else is closed.  I keep coming back.  I can't help myself.  This is a disease more than a quest for sustenance. Regardless of what you order the items taste the same.  The Taco Bell taste is a characteristic flavor and texture that immediately triggers the brain's memory.  The strange amalgam of ingredients seem to converge to an equilibrium for every menu item so that the result is always the same.  I'm sure PhD chemists were involved in this.  Like a Siren's song once you fall prey to its call, you can never break its grip on you.  Those who pray at the alter of the fourth meal temple are too familiar with this.  Don't believe me, check out the long lines in the drive thru after midnight.  It's a shared addiction suffered by midnight fast food junkies.  Anticipation heightens.\n\nI don't know what to say.  The food is inconsistent in every way. The portions vary wildly. The regular taco is noteworthy in this sense.  I've had them with literally a sprinkling of ingredients in the shell.  What manner of man does this to a hungry fellow man?  Oh, a cruel twist of fate.  A tragedy of Shakespearean proportions.  Did the preparer not think of our eventual disappointment upon discovery of an empty shell?  Should any man be confronted by such an existential moment so late at night on an empty stomach?   Anxiety riddles.\n\nThey routinely run out of ingredients.  \"We're out of tomatoes.  Is that OK?\"  \"On a Taco Supreme?  Are you kidding me?\" \"No more hot sauce?\"  \"What?  Isn't this supposed to be a Mexican food restaurant?\".  Who has the mental acuity this late at night to make such weighty decisions on an empty stomach no less?  Not me.  Frustration mounts.\n\nThe iconic Burrito Supreme.  It was legendary when first unveiled years ago.  Today it serves only as a sad reminder of what was once the leading edge in burrito offerings.  It's now embarrassingly undersized with ingredients that mix together into an unidentifiable goo.  The stuff is almost fluid and seeps towards one end so by the time you open it at home, you have to squeeze it to even it out.  Can you imagine ever having to do this at Chipotle?  And yet I order one with every visit.  Help me.  Help me.  Hopelessness envelopes.\n\nAnd what is it that compels you to buy five tacos and two burritos every visit?  Yet ironically, you can never get full on Taco Bell food.  Your jaw tires before your stomach is ever full.  Unrewarded gluttony.\n\nService.  Volumes could be written about this.  Service at Taco Bell tends to be more of an event than an experience.  The bottom rung of the human food chain must start with the midnight shift at Taco Bell.  How long can it possibly take to get an order, punch a few keys on the register and slap together a couple of tacos?  The pace is excruciatingly glacial.  Impatience overwhelms.\n\nI shudder to guess what the turnover rate is for the midnight crew.   This is evidenced by the blank stares, the long hesitation, the occasional look of terror that are dead giveaways for a first day on the job.  It happens every visit.  These poor souls are the tip of the spear in fast food.  Like advance recon in infantry, these guys and gals don't last long.  They're human cannon fodder.  If you have an ounce of humanity in you, you can't help but pity them knowing you'll never see them again, even if you go back the next night.    Sorrow weighs heavily.\n\nAnd so ends another midnight trip to Taco Bell. All that suspense and adventure for eight bucks.  You laugh, you cry.  What other late night fast food joint offers more?", "stars": 5.0}

The reason for my call was my remote is not working. \nLiving in Mesa and finding out the location is in Gilbert (3 miles away) they sent me through an entire process of a warranty claim, and service call for somebody to call me back and set up an appointment just to get me a new remote.  Within 24 hours of a work day. So that means Monday for me. How insane is that? I just need a new remote. The product isn't even four months old!!!

Now I have to dismantle my DVR, losing all my prescheduled recorded programs and hook my HD antenna directly to my TV, thus losing everything on my DVR that is going to be recorded in the next few days.

What you don't find too often in these industries is genuine people who actually care about the service they provide. Well, I accidentally found it through my home warranty out of all places, to fix a pool that had become a money pit. So much so, I was contemplating selling my home. TRUE STORY! We spent over $2,000 on leak detection, check valves and automatic valve replacements of the whole system, only to be left with the same problem  (a spa back flowing into my pool). This problem not only cost maintenance fees but increased my water bill by $200 a month for the past 6 months. I won't ramble, but it's been one of the worst home issues we've ever had. Then, I get a call from Jim telling me in a thick accent that he's going to fix my problem. I didn't believe him and he proved me wrong. It took him 30 minutes to do something several other companies tried and failed. And yes I will list names...Alchemist, Splash Pools, Silver Valley Pool and Spa Repair. Every time I called every single one of these companies to tell them I'm still having the same problem, they didn't return calls or reply to messages. Apparently, my problem was too complicated. Jim thought outside of the box and saved me from throwing this house on the market and $1000s of dollars. I cannot tell you how grateful I am for this company and for simply CARING about a troubled homeowner's swimming pool. I would recommend Jim, for anything.

I came in looking to order food for takeout and get home to drown my sorrows in comfort food. i was directed by the hostess up front to go stand by the bakery and i would be able to order take out. i waited not 15 seconds and was greeted with a huge smile from a lovely girl named Danielle. She gave me a menu and told me to ask if i had questions and inquired if i had been there before. i looked at the menu for some time, unable to clear my mind enough to decide. She told me i was welcome to take a seat, and when i apologized for taking so long she responded with a smiley \"where's the fire? take your time, can i get you a glass of wine while you decide?\" wine was a perfect idea! I finally ordered and sat drinking my wine. i waited, and then waited a little longer, Danielle the young girl doing take out informed me the kitchen was working as fast as they could but are very busy, she apologized for the wait and offered complimentary bread  and convinced me to buy a a second glass of wine. When she brought me the second glass i had just gotten off the phone and was visibly shaken with more bad news. Somehow this young girl had the courage to ask if everything was alright and what she could do to help. It was just the olive branch i needed. Just the inquiry was enough to make me feel better. i told her i was fine and thanked her for her compassion. finally my food was ready. She boxed everything with care for the drive home. All this time smiling. i couldn't help but notice Danielle interact with the other employees they always laughed or high fived her with each exchange. She had brightened my day, and it was clear she is a light for others in Mimi's Cafe. This is the kicker...my bill was $30 and some change...i gave her what i thought was two $20 dollar bills, but in reality was a $50 and a $20. The young girl ran outside and stopped me saying sir, I'm not sure these bills are right. i was overwhelmed by her honesty and told her no, i thought they were two 20's but the difference would be her reward for honesty. The food was tasty and just what i needed.

{"review_id": "6_95", "text": "Several weeks ago the \"check engine\" light on my 2006 Impala showed codes for possible transmission problems.  Based on the great Yelp reviews I drove 110 miles to this AAMCO to have it checked out.  Just prior to my arrival the \"check engine\" light went out.  The owner, Scott, had one of his technicians test drive it.  He couldn't find anything wrong.  Scott said there would be no charge, but to bring it back if the light came back on.  \n     Last week the light came back on and I took the car to a local Auto Zone to get a print out of the problem, which indicated two potential transmission issues (after which the light went out again).  Last week I returned to AAMCO and gave him the error code printout from Auto Zone.  Scott had a technician inspect various parts of the transmission.  The cause of the periodic \"check engine\" light was narrowed down to several possibilities.  Scott recommended that, since it seemed to be running OK at the moment it would not be cost effective to go further and start fixing things, running up a bill with no guarantee that it would correct the problem.  He gave me some paperwork to take with me spelling out the potential issues.  Scott said that since he couldn't fix anything for me there would be no charge.  The thing is, by having his technician spend the time to diagnose the problem and providing me with the results, I believe he really did help me going forward.  Oh, and not only that. while checking for the original problem the AAMCO technician fixed a sloppy shift lever, which now shifts precisely and perfectly.  Even so, Scott did not charge me even for that service!\n     I cannot praise this business highly enough.

{"review_id": "6_96", "text": "We purchased a Bullfrog spa about 2 1/2 years ago and the motor started overheating and freezing up @3 months ago. It is under a full warranty for 5 years, so I contacted the company where we bought it. It was first part of summer & the company said their technician was swamped so it would be a few days-week before he could call me to schedule an appointment. I was ok waiting, initially. After repeated phone calls the tech finally called me. He was asking me a bunch of questions, trying to diagnose the problem on the phone. He kept trying to make it a \"user error\" issue, like if I pushed the right buttons it would be fine. We'd had the spa over 2 years & pretty much used it every day, I knew it wasn't user error. Finally, I told him that he would just have to come out and see for himself that it wasn't working. At this point he tells me it's $190 service fee just to come out! I was in shock! I'm ok with a service call charge but $190 is a bit much on a fully warranted item! This company is the ONLY LV retailer for Bullfrog Spas, so I called Bullfrog directly. They told me that they had been having issues with this vendor refusing to provide service after the sale or making it so expensive that customers were complaining. Then they gave me the name/number for Silver Valley Pool/Spa repair. It was a completely different attitude with prompt service and excellent technical support. April promptly scheduled an appointment (& they are BUSY) for a few days out. She told me that they do have a service charge of $90 but that would be applied to anything if not under warranty.  Anthony was the technician who came over. Within 3 minutes of removing the panel, Anthony confirmed there was a legitimate issue with the motor. He called the office to get a new one ordered before close of business that day & April scheduled him to come back @6 days later. The new motor arrives and Anthony installed it within a few minutes. Bc the spa had to be emptied there was no way to check it at that moment. We filled the spa that afternoon and then ran the pump. Uh oh, there was a leak. We promptly called April who then scheduled Anthony to come right back the next day. Again, Anthony quickly determined that Bullfrog had sent a defective manifold attached to the motor. We'd need to get a new motor/manifold. Due to no fault of Silver Valley Pool repair it took another 10+ days to get it here. April was great at keeping me informed and staying on top of the situation. Finally the new parts came in, Anthony was back at the house and reinstalled the new motor. We filled it and have been happily using it since. I can't say enough good things about the customer service and the technical service we received. Their service charge was reasonable at $90. They cared that we had to wait so long and made every effort to return as quickly as possible. April & Anthony are great at their jobs and an asset to their company.

{"review_id": "6_114", "text": "I don't like owning a pool. In fact, I offer anyone who will listen the opportunity to dig it up and take it home for free. No takers yet. For 10 years, we used the typical \"guy with a pickup truck\" pool service. I assumed having it look clean for 3 days and kind of ok for 4 days was normal - after all, the vacuum can't reach all parts of the pool, right? And then our pool company had ownership issues and quality declined.\n\nIn desperation, I turned to Island Time due to their glowing review on the Nextdoor app - and their web page that states they pay above industry wages and offer employees health insurance.  Island Time offered a next-day estimate that ultimately led to approximately $1800 in repairs. After the last repair, the water was downright murky. My immediate thoughts were, \"oh my god, what have we done?\" The last thing I ever wanted to do was actually put money into the pool, and it looked worse than ever.  \n\nI called their receptionist who told me the supervisor would come out to clean the pool himself the next day...and my relationship with my pool has never been the same. I had no idea the pool could look clean and inviting 7 days a week, that water could actually sparkle, nor that employees could leave a detailed checklist every week stating the work completed and chemicals applied. The pool vacuum reaches every corner. The filter and motor hum. The pool is a pleasure to look at...and even use. I am even beginning to think about remodeling the pool, so the physical plant looks as good as the water that fills it.\n\nIsland Time is certainly not the cheapest pool service. But like many things in life - you get exactly what you pay for. They are professional, prompt, and a pleasure to do business with. Call Island Time and fall in love with your pool.", "stars": 5.0}

{"review_id": "6_116", "text": "Is your dog a nuisance? Does your dog get underfoot, or \"go\" in the house, jump up on visitors, or howl when you're not home? Does your dog injure your other pets, growl at you, or even bite you? Well, mine did. How about basic obedience training? Does your dog sit when you say sit, or come when you call? Mine did not. In my adult life I have raised five dogs from puppies to adulthood and Cleo the Pomsky was by far the worst dog I've ever had. She had separation anxiety, clinical claustrophobia, and a nevious panting and drooling problem. She was everything I mentioned above, and then some. She had no respect for humans, no intention to coexist in a home with others, and no comprehension of the concept of man's best friend. I did a good thing. I rescued a puppy, but after living with Cleo for about a year, I was at my wits' end. I just couldn't imagine another eight or more years of urine soaked floors, poop everywhere, bleeding dog bites, doggie anarchy, a child afraid of her own pet, and a home with no boundaries. I knew we would not be able to keep Cleo any longer if we did not get some good professional help- and fast! We had burned through three highly recommended dog trainers, a certified animal behaviorist, and even a doggie psychic, with no improvement at all. I felt defeated. I felt I had exhausted all my resources at home here in Los Angeles, so out of total desperation I made the decision to track down an exceptional dog trainer I had worked with successfully in the past. \n\nTwelve years ago, when I live in Phoenix, Arizona, Toni Drugmand trained my Japanese Akita, Roxy. Before Toni, Roxy was aloof and unresponsive to average training methods. At first I was hesitant, but it turned out I just didn't fully understand how e-collar training really worked. In the right hands, it's not meant to hurt your dog. It's just meant to get his attention and help him focus. After one visit with Toni, I understood the method and I was on board! Roxy became the most obedient and loyal dog I have ever had the pleasure of owning. Roxy is long gone now, but when she was alive people would stop us on the street to compliment me on my well behaved companion and ask for the name of my trainer! \n\nAfter remembering my past experience with Toni and Roxy, my mind was made up. We needed the best. We needed TONI DRUGMAND! So I scoured the internet, then e-mailed her with my dilemma. Her office responded promptly to suggest we have a phone consultation since we lived in different states. We lived too far away to do weekly in home and group training sessions, so Toni agreed to board and train Cleo for three weeks if I could just get her to Arizona. A few weeks later, I took a weekend off work and we drove Cleo to Toni's training facility. Cleo experienced Toni's standard three week board and train package. Toni sent me daily updates on Cleo's progress via video clips and pictures sent directly to my phone. When we returned to pick up Cleo, Toni did individual on and off leash training sessions with every family member in a public place full of doggie distractions. She wanted to make sure each of us knew exactly how to maintain Cleo's training at home. Cleo was a whole new dog! She was more affectionate, more interested in attention from people, more relaxed, followed all basic commands on and off leash (sit, heel, come, place, off, and was even starting to learn the amazing sit in motion!), was potty trained for the first time in her life, and stayed on her \"place\" even under distraction! Toni fixed Cleo. That's what it comes down to. If you need a dog trainer for any reason, big or small, look no further. Toni is the right choice. In my opinion, Toni Drugmand is the ONLY choice. If she can rehabilitate Cleo, she can train any dog, so call her now. Your dog will thank you.", "stars": 5.0}

{"review_id": "6_125", "text": "- - - REALLY! - - - It's true, my FIRST \"one-star\" review. After much discussion with my Elite Yelper mates, they have persuaded me to write this review. They argued, \"people need to know the truth\". The intention is to inform others, so I am going to dish the good, the bad, and the ugly...\n\nTHE GOOD\nWho doesn't like to look & feel GLAM? For events, I just love to go all out! Why the heck not? Actually, there doesn't even need to be an \"event\". Getting a makeover at M.A.C. is just a splurge I enjoy, to get myself into glamour mode before a fabulous day or evening out!\n\nFor the past 5 years, I have gone to M.A.C. for makeovers from Toronto to DC to NYC to Hawaii. And each and every single time, it has been consistent; M.A.C. makeup stylist are professional artists, and I always leave feeling like I'm ready to rock The Red Carpet! \n\nThe M.A.C.  located in The Bay on Queen Street is one place I frequent often. One memorable experience was with stylist \"Amy\". She also happens to be the Assistant Manager at this location, and as soon as I saw her fashion style and her cute peachy pink themed makeup, I knew she was talented! \n\nHOW IT WORKS\nFirst, you should be able to explain to your stylist the type of FUNCTION you are attending (wedding? dinner? clubbing? office party? just a shopping day?). Next, express the type of LOOK you that you want. (Glossy & Girly, Sexy & Smokey-Eyed, Bright & Bold, you name it!). If you have no clue - perhaps get a screen shot or tearsheet of what you are envisioning. But if you come unprepared - no worries - they have an Idea Book you could view. \n\nThen they take it away! And within an hour, your M.A.C. fairy godmother will transform you!\n\nAmy was amazing in that she was such a perfectionist! She asked me if there was anything else I wanted to ADD to my look, or change! And she didn't stop until we got just the right shade! Plus, she was just really down-to-earth and sweet as pie! And the end result? Wow! I am now a fan of Amy!\n\nCOMPLIMENTARY BEAUTY  \nTIP: Makeovers at M.A.C. \"stores\" usually charge a service fee (from $75 and up - confirm ahead). Whereas the M.A.C. \"counters\" at Department Stores, like The Bay (Canada) or Macy's (USA), the sitting fee & application service is complimentary - but you are obligated to purchase a minimum of $50 in merchandise. (Price may vary depending on location, so inquire within). But it's a great deal if you need new make up products, because it's like getting a FREE makeover! I have TOO many M.A.C. cosmetics, but that doesn't stop me from getting made-up here for special events! \n\nNOW ... THE BAD & THE UGLY\nI had an event tonight and scored an appointment a week in advance. Today I got \"Jen\". The first thing I look for when I am assigned the makeup artist is look at her makeup. This reflects her style and her level of talent. She was going for the Nicki Minaj look, and looked stunning. I immediately felt at ease.\n\nMy request was simple. \"I'm going to dinner, so I want a look that's natural; I don't want to look like I have a ton of makeup on, something light,  just enhance my features. Oh! And smokey eyes, to make my eyes pop.\"\n\nWe chatted all throughout my session, as we had a lot in common. Both having design backgrounds, both dog lovers, both foodies, I yelp, and she reads them. \n\nAn hour later ... she is done, and hands me the magic mirror. ... I am AGHAST! I looked HIDEOUS! Not ugly, but hideous! I don't know what part of my request she understood, but she did the complete OPPOSITE of my request! \n\nThe makeup was caked on, my eyes looked like huge blue raccoon circles! \n \nI was too shocked and stunned, and too nice to say anything mean to crush her feelings, I just grabbed my sunglasses to hide my face, rushed home (head down) and washed my face immediately!\n\nFortunately, I don't have an important event to attend and had time to head home beforehand! And luckily, it's just make-up, it washes off easily! PHEEEWWW!!!\n\nOne NEVER forgets the BAD experiences that happens to them! My Yelpers friends suggested perhaps this was done intentionally. I wouldn't go that far, but I would say that she definitely lacks experience. Unfortunately, this single bad experience will resonate and prevent me from returning to this location!\n\nIronically, MAC has made me feel the most beautiful I've ever felt, in previous events, and the ugliest I've ever felt, tonight. \n\nPURPOSEFUL REVIEW\nThe point of this review: I hope that no one else experiences this! Though I am still a fan of MAC, I am not of this location. I advise everyone to BE HONEST - whether you love it or hate it. The truth hurts, but they need to know or they won't improve!", "stars": 1.0}

Spent months researching dentist and finalized my choice. I wanted a top rated dentist and money was not an issue.\n\nAfter $16k in crowns and composites, my dental work was pretty much finished per the dental office. Shortly after, I moved to Buckeye, AZ. I was still having oral pain which my Cali dentist said was just the fillings and would go away. \n\nA year later, still hurt.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 needed dental work done and went to a commercial dentist in buckeye, Sundance Dental I believe. They told her that her pain was sensitive teeth and no decay was located.\n\nAfter she put up with their lack of bed side manor while having cleanings done, she decided to not use them any longer.\n\nA month after her experience, a tooth shattered in my mouth. It was mostly composite material from the fillings.\n\nI was fearful of Sundance Dental. Shadow Mountain \"Dr Garrett DDS\" was the other dental office in the area. I called and made an appointment for the following day.\n\nAt my appointment they advise me the amount of composite on the tooth was a joke and I need a crown. Without stating their prices, I was charged $1500+ in California for the same thing. They were a fraction of the cost. I had the post and crown installed. \n\nSoon after, I had X-rays done only to find a volley of small cavities that my award winning dentist in California failed to locate. After I had the fillings completed, all my pain was gone.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 soon followed suit. She too had multiple small cavities that were pretty obvious and Sundance Dental didn't locate. Dr Garrett didn't bad mouth them (no pun intended) he stated the resolution of their equipment may be lower. Meaning, lower quality equipment. \n\nShe's finished her fillings as have I. The work was done efficiently, cheaply and effectively!  All staff are EXTREMELY friendly!!  After dealing with 7+ dental offices in my life, they are by far the best.\n\n\nHighly recommended!", "stars": 5.0}

I received a prompt reply and the man suggested I bring the car in for an inspection to get an accurate diagnosis. Paid around $65 for an inspection and they called me with the bad news that I did indeed need both the pressure hose and the power steering pump, with the estimate being roughly $1260 (holy cow!). I had previously talked to another shop who gave an estimate of around $850, so I decided to pick my car up and get a second opinion.  I called another reputable garage in my area and spoke to the owner, who was confused at why I would need both, seeing as the power steering worked when it had fluid, it just leaked out within a few days. They got me in quick and looked at my vehicle FOR FREE! They let me know that my current pump DID still work and I would only need the hose. They fixed my car the next day for just over $400 and my car has been running amazing since then.  I won't be going anywhere else now.

I live all the way up in the northwest part of the city but traveling to Henderson to Stephanie's studio was the most reasonable option financially.  I talked to Stephanie on the phone and she was so nice!  She said she wanted to know as soon as I was going to the hospital to have my baby so that she could make sure we got a slot scheduled at the perfect age (7-10 days is what she recommended).  She said she didn't care what time of day it was but to call her anyway.  I thought wow, this is a woman who truly cares about her business (she doesn't, you will see why in a few).  When we arrived with our brand new baby for pictures, they both looked like disheveled messes.  Husband in sweatpants with his stomach hanging out and Stephanie looking like she just woke up from a nap.  I realize this isn't nice to say but it is what it is.  Our newborn pictures came out amazing so I thought, who cares if they're a little strange.  We talked about doing 6 month pictures and then doing a cake smash for my sons first birthday.  She said if I do all three milestones, then she makes a beautiful video with the images set to music.  For the price and the quality it was a no brainer.  Not only did I go back for 6 month and first year photos, I also snuck in an extra session giving her even more of my money.  As my son got older, the quality of the pictures got progressively worse.  Stephanie had always been such a good communicator and we talked about what I wanted for my first year photos.  I sent her pictures that i had seen on pinterest just to give her an idea of what I liked.  She said that we could go across the street to the park and do some outdoor ones as well.  We showed up to do the outdoor pictures first and there was no park.  There was a tree on a curb where she took the worlds worst pictures.  In order to exclude the street and houses around she made the entire background white taking out all elements of the outdoors.  I was so upset.  The indoor pictures came out much better.  Because the outdoor ones were so terrible she offered to redo them AND in our area so that we wouldn't have to drive! I thought once again, she really does care about her work and her reputation.  We went to a park (an actual park) as planned but there was a wedding so we couldn't get in.  You would think she would have checked on this first, nope.  She then took us to a little tiny grassy area in the middle of a busy neighborhood.  I was so mad I thought let's just get this over with, I'm done.  These pictures came out pretty bad too due to her over editing them.  Now she has pretty much cut off all contact and even had a new \"office manager\" respond to me telling me that I will NOT be receiving my end of year video because she did a family session outdoors for free.  The outdoor session was to replace the horrible first year photos, not my video.  I complained and complained and she finally responded saying she will fix this.  I have checked in with no response and have not received my video.  My son is now almost 18 months old.  Spend the extra money people!! This is NOT worth the aggravation!!

{"review_id": "6_159", "text": "No class will ever feel this good. Or this bad. \n\n\"I'll follow you anywhere, Mich\u00e8le. I'd be lost without you,\" a student proclaims during the opening class exercise. Overwhelmingly moved, Mich\u00e8le replies: \"I believe you, hun. I know. Thank you. You have no idea what that means to me.\"\n\nOn another night Mich\u00e8le asks a student, \"Where would you be without this room?\" To which the student snaps back, \"In the gutter, Mich\u00e8le. That's where my life was headed. In the gutter.\" \"Or worse,\" she says. \"Yes. I'd be dead, Mich\u00e8le. I'd be dead.\" \"Maybe, hun. Maybe,\" she coos softly, and we all feel the weight of this.\n\nThrough sobs, a voice rings out: \"I've never known a love like this. This work saved my life!\" The voice is mine and I mean it. I look at Mich\u00e8le with a broken reverence and gratitude; I love her SO much. She smiles back at me and I feel the empathy I've longed for since childhood. This place is my home. These people are my family. I owe everything to Mich\u00e8le.\n\nReading this, I imagine you have alarm bells going off; words like cult and brainwash flashing. But for us, we never questioned what we were saying when it came to pledging our devotion. It felt instinctual and we were almost always praised for it. The room fosters a kind of group-think ignorance and boiling frog effect that makes the crazy look sane. It's packaged alongside an intoxicating love and acceptance that has the strongest of minds making excuses for the most toxic behavior. We look to each other; the hysteria blocking all common sense. \n\nMich\u00e8le carries herself with an inhuman amount of certainty. Ideas about life are stated as facts; no shred of doubt. She'll tell you who you are with unmatched authority: \"You hate all women, hun. You can say it.\" \"But I don't hate all women.\" \"Really? We all saw it in your body. Didn't everyone see that?\" A wave of hands rise. \"It's okay, hun. How many in here hate other women?\" More hands. \"See. You're not alone. But it's especially strong in you. And you know why? Because of your mother, hun.\" To which the student concedes, and we all agree: Mich\u00e8le is a genius.\n\nBut like a psychic, Mich\u00e8le uses vague assessments and the power of suggestion to seduce. Trust is built early on and we take her word as gospel. We cut our hair. We quit drinking. Quit having sex. Have more sex. Confront sexual abusers. Cut ties with family. Leave our partners. All because Mich\u00e8le says it will make us better artists. Better people. We hand the reigns over because no one in our lives speaks with this kind of command and love. When it comes to acting, we rely solely on her to tell us if it's truthful, if it's false, if we're in ego-land, if it's the best acting we've ever done. We don't know, until she tells us. Our autonomy is lost. She's the only arbiter of the truth.\n\nDuring my last class (although I didn't know that at the time), I booked a job that was causing me to miss the last two classes of the month. I wrote an e-mail to the studio explaining the situation, saying I was sad and that I'd be there in spirit. A little while later, Mich\u00e8le called me: \"I'm worried,\" she says with a big sigh. \"Why are you worried?\" I ask. \"Why am I worried, Devon?\" She challenges. \"I don't know...are you worried that I'm missing class?\" \"DEVON! Do you think I'm worried that you're missing class?!\" \"No, no. Of course not,\" I stammer. \"Why am I worried?\" \"Um, is it because I didn't call you personally?\" \"DEVON! Do you think I'm worried because you didn't call?\" \"No, no.\" Stupid me. I remember recently she said I was obsessed with celebrity, so perhaps it's that. \"You're worried that I'm already obsessed with celebrity,\" I state, knowing that recycling her own words is often the only way to get through these confrontations. \"Yes, Devon. You knew that, didn't you? You're already in the clouds. That e-mail you sent had no consciousness in it. That means you won't be conscious during the job. You won't do good work on the set. You won't be listening to the other actors. You're pretending that you haven't grown.\" My first reaction is to contest: all I've been thinking about is how excited I am to do good work on this job. Do the kind of acting she taught me. But after 3 years, I've learned not to argue. \"You're right,\" I say. \"I love you, Devon,\" she says. \"I'm in the middle of teaching the Toronto class right now, do you think I want to be making this call? I know you will not be happy on the job like this. If you'd said even once in your e-mail that you wanted to Skype into class, I would know you were in a good place, but you didn't. I feel better now though, do you?\" \"Yes. Thank you so much.\" I force my voice to sound choked up, to show how grateful I am. I'm scared she'll call me out for being fake, but she doesn't. We hang up and I feel sick. I had no idea I was in a bad place. Thank god I have Mich\u00e8le to tell me. And then, for a moment, everything's clear: this isn't about me. This is about her. It's always been about her.", "stars": 1.0}
{"review_id": "6_160", "text": "We got a screaming deal on a dishwasher a month ago (or so we thought), because it had been a display item.  In actuality, the unit never ran properly.  After using it the first time, we noticed water under the unit and the fridge next to it.  Spencer's won't  repair GE products, so we were directed to the manufacturer.  \n\nBefore the service provider arrived, we opened the unit and a repair ticket from Spencer's flew out.  Apparently, the unit was defective and Spencer's knew about it.  The ticket reads, \"leaks from the bottom\"...\"main pump flange not on - no clamp.\"  After the first two manufacturer service calls, the unit was still leaking water.  We called Spencer's to ask if we could obtain a new unit.  The salesman said we got a \"smokin' deal\" so we couldn't get a replacement unit.  The obvious problem with his reasoning is that something is only a good deal if it actually works.  In our case, not only does the unit not work, our floors are damaged.  We got nowhere with the salesperson and were left to navigate the GE claims process on our own.  Frustrated and angry do not begin to describe our feelings on the situation.\n\nOur terrible experience was completely redeemed by Joe Zamora, who I assume is the store manager.  When Joe learned of our problem, he reached out to us and  asked what he could do to resolve the situation.  Our dishwasher was replaced with a brand new unit the very next day (and on a side note, the delivery guys were great).  We thought we'd been blown off and left to deal with a corporate giant; instead, our concerns were addressed, options were presented, and our needs were met.  Spencer's made this right.  Spencer's has proved they are aware, concerned, and ready to meet or exceed expectations- very impressive in an age where customer service is waning.", "stars": 5.0}

{"review_id": "6_164", "text": "This is a review of Solid State Electric at 980 American Pacific Dr. in Henderson, NV.\nI have been having home theatre issues for 8 months now. Unfortunately, I've had the displeasure of dealing with two companies who have responded poorly to my issues. The first is JVC, the manufacturer of my HD projector, the source of my problems. For a big company, with a supposed stellar reputation, they have pretty much completely dropped the ball when it comes to my problems. Numerous phone calls and emails have gone unanswered. The second company is Video Audio Specialists on E. Charleston in Las Vegas. I defy you to come up with a worse company. Don't even try. They kept my projector a total of 7-8 days and found absolutely nothing wrong. I finally sent it to Mendtronix in Poway, CA. and they found a long list of problems, including filters that were completely and totally plugged and fans that were inoperable. Mendtronix was in awe when I explained that VAS found nothing wrong after 8 days. It took them 2 minutes and they said the issues were Diagnostics 101 (any idiot could see the problems). JVC sent me to VAS, and I have yet to hear back from either company (surprise, surprise). I have NOTHING positive to say about either.\nThe same is not true of Solid State Electric in Henderson. Run by Jason and Susan Burkett, they could not have been any better or more professional. A few technicians (usually Josh) have visited my home on numerous occasions, and I don't know what I would have done without them. They've stood by me every step of the way, and have gone beyond all of my expectations. Their prices are fair and reasonable and their professionalism unparalleled. Top to bottom you wont find a better electronics installation company anywhere in Las Vegas. What a pleasure doing business with them. Are you listening JVC and VAS???", "stars": 5.0}

{"review_id": "6_186", "text": "To make it simple--Dr. Lipman saved my life. Along with my amazing husband and the quick thinking of my plastic surgeon, Dr. Cambeiro, I'm alive to write this review. \n\nThere's not enough space to tell the 4 months of suffering I've gone through. But it all started with an undetected and untreated strep infection. Yes, your usual strep throat----but it bypassed my throat and it infected my breast. \n\nHere's the detailed story for those that are interested:\n\nUp until August 7th 2016, my 33rd birthday, I was a relatively healthy woman. With no major health problems, I didn't expect what was supposed to be a celebratory day, end in almost tragedy.\n\nI woke up on schedule to get ready for work, \nWithin 30 minutes of arriving to work, pain steadily increased. I tried to fight through it, but I ended up collapsing in excruciating pain and was rushed to the emergency room.\n\nMy heart rate was exceeding 135bpm, my blood pressure dropped extremely low and I was dripping sweat, while shivering in pain.\n\nAfter some testing, and several heavy doses of Dilaudid, I was left with no diagnosis. My plastic surgeon was out of town for the next two days, so I was advised to follow up with him upon his return.\n\nSo, we went home. I barely remember most of it. My fever shot up to 104.1\u00b0F, I was still in excruciating pain and I was convinced that I was going to die. I never felt pain to that degree. I've had natural childbirth, passed multiple kidney stones and I have several large tattoos. NOTHING remotely compares to the pain I was experiencing.\n\nMy husband CJ knew the severity of the situation. He saw the pain in my eyes. He was not going to let me suffer for the next two days. He called my plastic surgeon and emailed him a detailed update. Within the next few hours, Dr. Cambeiro returned early from his vacation and had me come immediately to his office, following the complete blood work that he ordered. Immediately recognizing the symptoms, he knew we had to act quick. While we were in the examination room, my blood results came back.\n\nMy white blood cell count was 44,000. My doctor had immediate concern in his face as he explained that he's never seen a white blood cell count that high. He said it was astronomical for someone like me.\n\nI was rushed into emergency surgery on Monday night, August 8th 2016 at 5:00PM. Due to the emergency circumstance, my surgeon, along with infectious disease specialist, Dr. Lipman, were left with no option but to remove my breast implant and all remaining breast tissue. Dr. Lipman knew the source and diagnosis of my condition only after asking 3-4 questions. He's a miracle worker. \n\nThey said I really didn't have much of a choice, but if I insisted, they could try an IV in-hospital treatment for a few days first. But it was a 50/50 gamble. It would either heal up nicely over the course of a few days .... or... possibly fall into full septic shock, fall into a coma, live in ICU, then most likely die.\n\nI might live in Las Vegas, but I'll never gamble with my life.\n\nFollowing the surgery, I spent another four days at the hospital in step down ICU, and one extra morning in the med surg/general post-operative care unit. I was discharged on 8/11/16.\n\n\nIf you suspect that you might have Sepsis, you need to treat it with the same urgency as you would a heart attack. Yes, it's THAT serious.

I was in desperate need to find a place close by who would be able to repair it before an event I had to go to. So I did a Yelp search and came across this place. I called beforehand because it fell under the cleaners category and customer service confirmed they repaired shoes as well. I was excited to learn this bit of info as well as it being opened and available 24/7. Most places are open only between the hours of 9-6. I'm at work during that time though. I saw Mint Locker got good reviews but I didn't bother reading them. I probably should have though because I didn't realize the concept of their business. When I arrived the door was locked. I peeked in the window like a stalker but only saw lockers. I called again and was told the door is opened by sliding a magnetic card (I.e credit card) thru the door and it grants you access to enter. Once inside I realized it's a drop off /pick up kind of gig. I'm not the most tech savvy  person so it did take me a few minutes to set up my profile online and create an account. Once I did I received an automated text message letting me know I can move forward with providing them the locker number I placed my shoes in. After locking up the shoes I called a third time because I forgot to ask on the previous call what the turnaround time was for them to fix the shoes. I'm sure the lady was probably irritated at this point but she was polite and proceeded to tell me that it usually takes between 5-7 days for shoe repairs. Mind you it was Thursday and I needed the shoes by Saturday afternoon for an event. The lady apologized and said they would try their best to meet the deadline. I ended up sending an email about needing it sooner if possible and received a reply back right away letting me know they could help me out. And they did. They came thru.

{"review_id": "6_202", "text": "Auto repair places used to be like a visit to the dentist. Painful! You go in with one issue and they tell you that you've got about $2K more in issues that need \"immediate attention!\"\n\nI read some good reviews about Vegas Auto Care after doing a google search. The review that stood out was from a lady who said she had never felt more comfortable at an auto repair place. That sold me to give VAC a shot. \n\nAfter my own experience I can't agree more! I went in with what I thought was a starter or alternator problem as I had only had my battery for a year and it was one from autozone with a 3-year warranty. After John ran some tests he came to me and said it was only a bad battery. I totally convinced myself that it was something else so a shady mechanic could have played off that and told me yes it was the starter or alternator. Not here!\n\nJohn showed me the batteries he had in stock and I told him mine was still under warranty so I could get it replaced for free.  I paid for the diagnostic and he let me drive away. \n\nAmazed?! I was too. Now prepare to have your mind blown!\n\nAs I'm at autozone the kid helping me change my battery touches the negative connector to the positive terminal (or the opposite). It shorts the fuse on the connector and my car won't do anything. Totally dead! I call John and he sends a tow truck down. \n\nOnce back at VAC he tells me it's the fuse and he'll need to order a part. It's the close of business on Friday so my car would be stuck there all weekend. I work on weekends at a nightclub so this totally doesn't work for me. \n\nWhat does John do? He rigs my battery to  bypass the dead fuse so my car will start so I can get around. He tells me to come back on Monday to get it fixed for real. He only charges me for the tow and I'm on my way. Seriously! What mechanic would ever do that?!\n\nWhen I return on Monday he says the part is ready for pick-up at a nearby Nissan dealership. I pick up the part and the guy at Nissan doesn't charge me. I get back and tell John he didn't charge me even though I tried to pay for it. John seemed a little peeved but at the Nissan dealership, not me. After he repairs my car I try and reimburse him for the part. He just smiles and hands me a stack of his business cards and tells me \"No charge. Spread the word.\"\n\nMind blowing!!!\n\nSo Yelpers, if you ever have a car problem do yourself a favor and go see John and his crew at Vegas Auto Care! ESPECIALLY if you're like me and were always afraid of getting shafted by a shady mechanic.", "stars": 5.0}

{"review_id": "6_222", "text": "Red Light Wing Chun - Testimonial\n\nWritten after 1 month of training.\n\nI relocated into Phoenix and after settling in I found myself with some free time that I didn't want to spend idling or in front of the television. I considered joining a gym even utilizing a free two day pass from LA Fitness after barely surviving the bombardment of their sales personal. It took two visits to realize how disinterested I was and came to the conclusion  that no amount of extravagance can mask the lack of regiment and support essential for a training facility.\n\nAfterwards,  I considered a boxing/kick boxing gym but was unavailable to find one to meet my open schedule. After complaining to my office manager about being bored in Phoenix, She suggested Meet-up.com. After navigating thru the local meet-ups I came across one about Wing-Chun. It was a martial art I was interested in and never had the opportunity  to experience. I had no reason not to go. \n\nI had a bit of a difficult time finding the place and I did not realize that the meet-up was set-up by a Wing-Chun instructor in a Martial Arts School. It was hidden away inside a building with no way to tell it apart from the outside world. The only sign is some lettering on the door.  Its far from your ordinary store front display, big sign martial arts school and even farther from the flamboyance of your corporate fitness centers.\n\nThe meet-up had people of various ages and skill level scheduled at 2pm every third Saturday of the month. It was enough to realize that this was a legitimate school with an instructor who is informed in health and fitness in having a background in physical training,  experienced in Wing-Chun with a level five certification, and the keen sense of awareness to pick up the subtle errors in form while being personable in communicating the proper technique to the individual. I signed up that day and have been dedicated since. The meet-up is also an opportunity to get pointers on technique from the instructors brethren from the school they originated from which I found to be valuable bonus.\n\nThe curriculum is staggered with the intention of focusing on one aspect of the art per month, broken up into 12 categories where the cycle completes and repeats after a year. There are students who have told me that they have learned during the second cycle more than the first. There is also the intent of gaining exposure of all aspects of the art within a year. The classes are evenings on weekdays and one on Saturday morning not including the two hour bonus every third Saturday afternoon. Once signed up you are entitled to unlimited classes which is rare to find in any school now-a-days.\n\nThere will be bruises, especially on the fore-arms. Part of the pain in \"no-pain, no gain\". After a while they feel like badges of accomplishment. Eventually  your body will harden and they will become less frequent. Im starting to miss them already.\n\nI have met new friends although it feels more like a family. I have lost body fat and gained muscle in areas I have not been utilizing transforming into a more tone and proportionate body. I have learned techniques in self-defense all while maintaining interest and having fun. My pains from past surgeries are a rare occurrence now and Red Light may have helped me reach my physical prime. \n\nI find the potential benefit far out-weighs the costs. I find myself very fortunate to have encountered this opportunity in my life and fore-see years enveloped in this system before losing interest, as there is so much to learn.\n\nThanks to Grandmaster Ip-Man for adding to the establishment of this art and teaching it to others where it eventually found its way into our lives. May he be at peace and may we represent him in a good manner.", "stars": 5.0}

When my phone broke a few months ago, I took it to this store expecting them to follow through with what they told me, and the associate helping me said \"well no, that's not how it works. We'll give you a new phone, but at a discount price.

{"review_id": "6_246", "text": "***It's been almost two weeks since I last visited Matt Sevco (the owner of Mak Auto) & I've kind of been going back & forth in my head as far as whether or not I should write this review. As being someone who relies heavily on reviews myself, I felt obligated to go through with this and share my experience with you, the consumer. This should be an interesting read, enjoy.*** In about a week I was heading to Phoenix  to pick up a brand new car. While in town I was staying with a buddy in Mesa for a few days to get out of Prescott & enjoy the city. I asked if he knew of anyone who could do a good job tinting my windows in my new car. He recommended Mak Auto since it was close to his house & had had some work done there himself in the past. I called Matt about a week out to schedule an appointment time/date. Fast forward a week later, that next Monday, I dropped my car off at 8am. I thought it was odd that Matt needed my car until 2-3pm that afternoon b/c I've had many cars tinted in the past & a good tint job usually only takes 2-3 hours at most. He assured me his tinter would want to be \"super meticulous\" and that's why they needed it all day. This was comforting to know & I actually gave Matt a crisp $20 to give to his tinter to insure a job well done. When I picked my car up at 2:35pm I paid the $200 charge & was told that I would see some streaks & bubbles in the windows & that they wouldn't look good until the tint cured; that sounded about right to me. So, I got in the car & left. After driving for about 20 minutes I realized there were scratches ALL over the tint. It looked like a cat had gotten a hold of the roll of film that was used on my car. I pulled over & called Matt immediately, at 2:55pm & then again at 3:49pm & was told both times Matt was \"in a meeting\". That was Ryan's way of saying Matt doesn't want to deal with this right now. That next Tuesday morning I drove up to Mak Auto to speak to Matt in person & to show him my car. He came out to have a look & couldn't believe what he saw. He was extremely apologetic and assured me this had never happened before. He also told me that his tinter must have had a faulty tool & promised me that he would take care of it the next day & that the car would be stripped & re-tinted free of charge. Although this was an inconvenience he seemed willing to make it right & I appreciated that. Later that day, around 4:45pm Matt called & left  me a voice-mail saying there was no possible way he could get my car in & have this problem fixed & that we'd have to do it another time. Well, here's the thing...I live in Prescott & Matt knew this. So, was he really expecting me to drive over 200 miles, round trip, to go down to Mesa one day & have my windows re-tinted by the same guy that neglected to do a good job in the first place? I think not. That next morning I again found myself driving up to Mak Auto to speak with Matt. When I got there I told him of my dilemma; I had a botched tint job on my brand new $35k car & wanted the tint removed & my money refunded & that I was going to have them re-tinted elsewhere. He told me \"that isn't going to happen\". I also mentioned that if he didn't do this I would not only have to re-pay to get them re-tinted somewhere else, but also have to pay to get them stripped. He said \"well, that's on you\". I couldn't believe this. I then reminded him of two things that he had said to me that struck me as odd; both regarding his supposed strive for excellence in what he does and his policy toward complete customer satisfaction & how he wasn't living up to either. He said, & I quote; \"Oh please, if you're so perfect and you never make mistakes you really may want to step off of that high horse of yours and lower your expectations a bit\". He also felt I was being completely \"unrealistic\". I think not. Well...the plot thickens. On my way back home I stopped in a very reputable tint shop to get their opinion &  not only did they confirm the scratches were from a mixture of faulty tooling & inexperience; they also noticed several tears in the tint that the tinter had tried to hide. Also they noted that on my two front windows the tint wasn't even applied the correct way & maintained that they hadn't seen a tint job this bad in a long time. I was advised I that I may want to call the manufacturer of the tint Matt/Mak Auto claimed they used, which was Sungaurd & complain to them. I talked to Armando from the AZ Sungaurd office & he hadn't heard of either Matt/Mak Auto or the tinter that worked there; which is to say that Matt/Mak Auto wasn't even an authorized dealer of the tint they advertised to use. Turns out they were using some cheaply made Korean tint. Hmm...where's the ethics on that one there Matt? Conveniently however, when confronted by Sungaurd's Rep Matt had just let go the tinter that botched my tint job b/c he's already had several warnings & complaints. Well, if that was the effing' case, then Matt, why'd you let him tint my car?", "stars": 1.0}

During time with my quads I was in so much I should have had a speed pass. \n\nToday was my last visit. I was the first customer of the day.  The young man up front was nice and got me from the parking lot with a wheel chair. As I couldn't walk from the tremendously hurting ankle. He was 5 star nice. \n\nThe X-ray tech Marie was nice and careful with the wheel chair. Took her time taking me for x-rays and made sure to back into rooms to avoid hitting my foot. Thx Marie. \nShe also took care to deliver me back to my vehicle. \n\nNow the reason for the score. Dr Tracey. \nI have broken nearly every bone in my body over the years and this ankle hurt as bad as any of those.  I couldn't stop my eyes from tearing up from the pain. \nDr Tracey said she had a prescription that would ease the pain and eliminate swelling (even though I had no swelling) and another that would help with sleep because the pain was so bad I couldn't sleep. \n\nI trusted her to give me something that would work but was concerned because in all the years I had been coming there no one had ever prescribed this before. \nTwo and a half hours later I get the prescriptions filled and take them. \n\nI laid down with ice and 5 hours later still in crazy pain. I look up the pill and it just an anti inflammatory medicine. Not for pain. I called back to the urgent care to ask if we could get something that would work prescribed because this isn't right or working. \n\nDr Tracey refused. She said that's what you get. She would not reconsider. So now 7 hours later I'm left to go to the emergency room and see some one that will lesson to the patient and care if a medicine is working. \n\nI later shared my experience with my wife and we discovered her reasons for not returning were the same as mine. Dr Tracey. \n\nSave your money. It's not worth the visit to Dr Tracey. \n\nGood bye Warner urgent care.", "stars": 1.0}

After trying to cut under an area heading toward the register, I stopped them and directed them to the exit. They refused to wait another second and demanded cutting under a few blocked off areas. I then explained that this would not happen due to the volume of customers we were dealing with. Again, they insisted that they were going to do as they pleased. After a small argument, they cut under the blocked area, went to the parking lot, and exited the property. By no means was I trying to cause any trouble for the couple.

Heart tests came back fine.  So,  I let it go. In November I started breaking out in a rash went back to Lindsey she gave me a steroid.

I went to Natural Balance hormone Center for more testing they discovered that I had had strep which was causing the fluid around my heart and a rash over 90% of my body. I've been carrying strep in my system for over a year which Lindsay should have done extensive blood work to find out why I had fluid around my heart. She did not and in May 2018 I was diagnosed with Sjogren's disease, all because of undiagnosed strep. Homewood's office didn't do anything to find out why I had fluid around my heart.

{"review_id": "6_264", "text": "I feel like getting your haircut is one of those things we all take for granted.  We form a dependence whether we realize it or not on that one person we trust every few weeks to clean us up and send us back into the world with a renewed spirit that can only come from a fresh cut. You feel better, your confidence rises, and more than likely you timed that haircut around a big trip, event, or date in which you wanted to look your best.\n\nNow imagine you are ready for that reliable haircut and you call up your barbershop for an appointment only to realize the person you depend on every month no longer works at the shop. I have experienced that feeling multiple times in my life and it always sucks.  Suddenly you are starting over from scratch.  No idea if the next person is going to chop your hair up and send you away looking terrible.  It takes two or three new people before you finally find someone you are comfortable with to cut your hair properly.  I swear it's like losing a girlfriend or something, you never realized how much you relied on that person for your well being until they are gone from your life and you have to start all over again.\n\nI learned that lesson one to many times so when I finally found Andrea at Honey Cuts in Huntersville a couple years ago I made sure to let her know I didn't want that scenario to repeat itself. Fast forward to today, like all things time changes everything and Honeycuts is no longer in the Lake Norman area. Luckily true to her word Andrea let me know that she was still available and cutting hair in Cornelius, and even better she was now working for herself.\n\nYour trusted barber having their own place is the perfect scenario.  Now instead of calling a shop to confirm what days she is working I just have to call her directly.  She will fit you in based on her schedule that week and still offers all the same services including hot towel and neck shaves at the same price.  Her new location is right beside Pop's BBQ headed down 115 towards Davidson.\n\nIf you are new to the area or a long term fan of Honeycuts definitely stop by Andrea's new shop. I can't tell you how comforting it is to finally work with her directly. I didn't have to follow her to another shop and deal with some new place's higher prices or worse start over from scratch. She has a chair in her own salon now so I can trust I will always be in for the same haircut, at a fair price, and best of all she is available even more than before now that she is in charge of her own hours.", "stars": 5.0}

{"review_id": "6_266", "text": "Let me preface this with saying that I'm not sure how this will end up, but I am rating on my experience so far. Went in on Tuesday, my first time ever looking at a Jeep product which I made clear to the sales guy.  I told him that I was either interested in the Renegade or Patriot. I told him that I had looked at their site and had seen some Patriot High Altitudes that I liked, but didn't know much about Jeep so wasn't sure what my option were. I told him the color I preferred, and that I wanted upgraded stereo that i could control my iphone/playlists through it, and a sun/moonroof. He asked if he could show me a Patriot they had outside so  I could get an idea of the size difference because he didn't think the Renegade would be big enough for my family (I had my two boys in tow). He showed me one, and we drove it because I wanted to know what the ride/ visibility was like. He said several times that he understood that the car I drove wasn't what we talked about, but wanted to know if it felt right. We went in and sat when he returned he said that he found the car that had everything I wanted and it was on another lot, the sales manager \"Bama\" came over to talk a bit then he and the sales guy (can't remember his name, but he had- lets say,distinctive- teeth) walked away. The sales guy came back and sat with me and chit chatted, I told him how worked full time and went to school at night and basically live in my car commuting place to place and its super important that I have good access to media in the car as I often listen to study playlists, and want/need to be totally hands free.  Bama returned and talked preliminary numbers and the price he quoted was on par with the Patriot High Altitudes that I had looked up on their site. With that idea in mind we were happy with the price. There was a lot going on as we had two trade-ins, one still at home, and it was almost closing time, we needed to clean out my car, get the new car, drive home and return with my husband's trade in. At around 8pm (they close at 9, we arrived around 3:15- as you can imagine everyone was tired, hungry, and the kids were done), the sales guy come out and said that they were just cleaning the car's tires- mind you, we haven't actually seen the car yet because the sales guy didn't want to go to the other lot to get it. I know, I know, should've been a sign- hindsight!  Because finishing up tires shouldn't take long, my husband loaded the kids into his car so he could go home, clean out his truck, and have it ready to bring back to the dealership when I got there to follow him back. I stood in the parking lot waiting alone in the cold for another 20-30 minutes. When they sales guy finally showed up with the car he handed me a single key and said he'd see me when we got back. I dashed home, hopped in my husband's car (not the trade-in) because that's where the car seats were and followed him back to dealership. The next morning in the daylight I got in the new car to head to work and, now able to get a good look, realized that the interior didn't look like what I had seen online. My husband called and spoke to Bama. He told him that the stereo system wasn't what I had asked for and that we also had the issue of only a single key. Bama admitted that he knew the sales guy had screwed up and had reprimanded him for not going and getting the car so we could see it the night before. Then he said not to worry about the second key because \"if you're swapping out cars it's not an issue\". He then said that he was the only person involved in the sale who was there that day and he would call the next day (Thursday) between 1-2pm once everyone was back at work. He never called. My husband and I both left messages on his cell phone and no response. This morning I emailed him - no response. I contacted my attorney this evening. I really wish they would just have the decency to respond and resolve this. The model car that was actually delivered is listed on their site (with the same incentives that we got- so we qualify for everything advertised) at thousands less than what we paid- which is clearly because we/ they though we were getting the upgraded version which has all the amenities we had talked about and is perfectly on par with what we agreed to pay. Worst car buying experience I've ever had. I hope that I can update this in a few days and say that they made everything right.", "stars": 1.0}

I went into the shop yesterday to  show them the tattoos I wanted  to cover up and show them a picture of the new tattoos I wanted to cover with. I wanted a pink watercolor flower with black integrated in the piece obviously to cover up my tattoos on my wrists. I chose this place because my friend goes there and gets her tattoos done by a guy and I figured they might be a little bit cheaper than my FIRST CHoIcE which was CLUB TATTOO. I was prepared to pay ANY cost .... as long as I got the masterpiece that I wanted and covered these tattoos. I have been waiting 10 years to get these tattoos covered. the meaning behind them brings horrible memories of my past and I was beyond thrilled that I was going to be able to get them done today. So yesterday I showed Carrie what I wanted I showed her the picture and she was like \"yes I can do that\" quoted me a price $250!!!! I was expecting so much more so I was thrilled and she said she could get me in the following day which happened to be my birthday! I even told her it was my birthday. Greatest present ever I thought! Finally get to cover these up a longtime dream of mine with the sickest tattoo I could think of to cover them and the price was amazing. I planed my entire birthday around this appointment. I showed up and the second I walk through the door I was greeted with a guy saying \"hi I'm so sorry Carrie double booked herself and I'm going to be taking care of your tattoo today\" that at first was annoying like seriously how could u double book yourself? I look over and she is working on a large tattoo covering someone's back. I immediately feel like she tossed me off on this dude because that persons tattoo was going to cost more than mine. Then I show this guy the picture ....what Carrie promised she could do yesterday and he says it's NOT possible to do... which I then state that Carrie saw the picture yesterday and said she could do it and why not it doesn't make sense use the black center to cover my cursive words and then the rest of the flower be the watercolor ...he then went to Carrie who said \"oh I thought we were gunna just do something kinda like that as a reference \" and I was super shocked and said no... I showed u this picture saying \" I want to do an amazing watercolor tattoo and you said it could be done\" long story short I got my 100$ deposit back and left went to club tattoo who said they could Of course do it just like the picture. I just can't believe my experience today it ruined my birthday completely got my hopes up and it was an awful experience. That was very unprofessional for Carrie to do she didn't even apologize herself. Don't go here there are a lot of better places. I ended up going to a great place called studio 21 after I had my consultation at club tattoo and they were so professional and the guy said once again of course we can for sure do that picture I wanted which makes me feel like bad apple doesn't know what they are talking about.", "stars": 1.0}

I then called up another dentist who saw me the next day (hudec) he upd my medicine, gave me medicine for the swelling of my gums, and a prescription for medicated mouthwash. He also took 5 min out of his busy day to help me. I was actually able to sleep through the night on my new meds, n was actually feeling better the next day. I was very impressed with them,  and truly regretted going to Dentist Brian's office after getting such good care from the other place. Also dentist Brian smith office called the next day saying he looked at my x rays, n wanted to c me. I would of thought he would of did that the day I came when I was near tears when he told me I was lucky he saw me. Please check out other places before going to him, go to someone who actually will care about you and your well being,  and take the time out to care about your needs.

Also, had I bought my dress at another shop, I'd probably be very disappointed on my wedding day. I went to J majors and found a dress I really liked. I wanted to have some customizations done which seemed like no problem. I put my deposit down and came back a week later to get measurements done for the customizations. Turns out, what I wanted wasn't possible without possibly hurting the integrity of the dress. In other words, if we lowered the back as much as I wanted, the dress might fall down (it was strapless). I was devastated. I cried for a while and then called and told them I was so upset. They assured me this was all going to be ok and invited me back to talk about the options. When I went back, we decided we were going to add lace straps. I couldn't picture it but was putting a ton of faith in the designer and overall was feeling less and less confidant about my dress. A week later, Bridget called me and said \"I woke up thinking about you last night, I don't feel like you're totally in love and set on this dress and these straps. Why don't you come back in and we'll try it on again, just to be sure you're 100% sure.\" She woke up thinking about me?! Of all of their brides (and every thing else going on in life) IIII was what she was concerned about? I was shocked and so thankful. I went back in with one of my bridesmaids, tried on the dress again and my face really said \"meh.\" I wasn't in love. Esp. with the pending changes. Bridget asked me if there was anything I'd like to try on and I quickly pointed to the dress I'd been eyeing since I walked in that day. I put it on and the rest was history. It's PERFECT. No questions asked, I was allowed to change my dress because they knew I didn't love my original selection. That level of customer service and individual help does not happen every where. I have worked with pretty much everyone at the salon now and they are all so amazing. They really value customer service and really care how you feel about your dress.

{"review_id": "6_301", "text": "I came on Yelp a few weeks ago looking for reviews of local acupuncturists and since I couldn't find many, I thought I should write a review to help others...\n\n I've been having stomach pain and digestion issues  for 4-5 months. After lots of testing and trials of different medicines, my doctors diagnosed me with IBS--but I've had adverse or allergic reactions to every medication, so I thought it was time to try an alternative medicine route. I called Dr. Lee's office in hopes to find some relief through acupuncture. I had never tried acupuncture before, but I know many people in the Bay Area who have (and who swear by it), so I thought it couldn't hurt. I talked to Dr. Lee directly and asked him many questions over the phone--and he assured me that he could perform acupuncture methods that would help me with my stomach pain. So I made an appointment for the following week, and looked forward to my first meeting with Dr. Lee.\n\nThe office is in a nondescript building that I've driven by thousands of times before...so I almost missed it, but the inside of the office is nice, with soft music playing and the scent of herbs/incense, and there are lots of books/certificates/posters around the office. \n\nI was greeted by the receptionist and given new patient paperwork to fill out, detailing my symptoms. When I was done I was taken back to Dr. Lee's office and waited for about 10 minutes until he came in. He looked at my paperwork, then asked me questions about my symptoms, but he didn't seem to be listening/believing my answers, because he asked the same questions repeatedly, or asked me questions after I had already told him the information. He then proceeded to tell me that there was \"nothing he could do for me\" as far as acupuncture goes, and that my \"ONLY HOPE\" was to use a special herbal tea which he happens to make and sell himself. He kept going on and on about the tea, and I was open to learning about it...until he told me that it would cost $350 for a two-week supply. I told him that I really could not afford that, and as soon as he heard that he seemed to write me off--he picked up my paperwork and said, \"Well, save your money and come back--we will keep your file for 6 months\". I was then quickly ushered out of the office. \n\nFortunately, since this was just a new patient consultation, I did not have to pay for this \"advice\", but I was extremely mad/frustrated and felt that he was just trying to sell me the tea, and didn't really care about me as a patient. I'm sure that the tea probably does help people, but it's not in my budget, and I felt I was misled after our phone conversation, where I specifically had asked about acupuncture, not $350 tea. \n\nThe funny thing is that he told me there was \"nothing acupuncture could do for me\", and yet I've been seeing a different acupuncturist (who is a lot nicer and seems to actually care about her patients) for two weeks now, and I have already seen an improvement in my health.", "stars": 1.0}

My father brought it home on my 3rd birthday...he had no present for me...unless you call a slap and \"don't ever come in my room again\" a present. Knowing him...I do. Years later he passed out and his Swisher Sweet fell out of his hand and burned down our trailer...for the 5th time.  I cried for the chair that had made it through 4 fires, 8 wives, 9 waitresses named \"Rose\" and a guy in a dress...named \"Rose\"...and it was gone. Craftsmanship, luck...and an incredible amount of lubricant has protected it over the years.  My father wept. He cursed God. He flogged himself with the red plastic track for my toy cars.  He ran away...neither me or his badly burned 9th female Rose ever saw him again.  I heard he spent decades trying to replicate the feel of that basket. an obsession that nearly killed him. Rose despite his burns was a good stepmother to me....until...well...that is another story.\n\nRex remembered...he remembered the squeals of delight...the screams of ecstasy...the snapping of the chain and the cries of help from my father and his companion of the day. He was insastiable...and animal...I was insatiable...and animal. I read everything i could about the Pacific rim...i nicknamed my anus \"The Atlantic Rim\"...I was a scholar of all things Asian. I even bought pictures of tigers on black velvet...very Asian.  I had two true Asian loves...Margret Cho and sushi.  Margret left me for some film director...I was crushed...but my search for all things sushi never subsided.  I would go to the finest sushi houses. I would eat canned tuna straight from the can. I was hardcore.\n\nIn these times of want and woe....I want roe...as much of it as I can eat.  All you can eat sushi is usually like having a naked dance party in a Weight Watchers...never good...and not good examples of what fun you COULD be having...if you were in a different situation.  Kai Sushi and Steakhouse is like having a naked dance party in the backstage area of the Victoria Secret modeling show.  It is heaven. It is perfection. It is better than Margret Cho in my father's basket. My dream of good all you can eat sushi is realized...great all you can eat sushi for under 25 bucks!!  If this is dreaming...don't wake me up.\n\nI will start out with something not necessarily brought up first when reviewing all you can eat sushi...they have the best mussels in town! Bar none. Amazing. A touch spicy. A touch sweet. The best ever. Their sushi rolls are perfect. Great mix of some sweet, some crunchy, some with acidity, some with a combination.  The best roll...the Lion roll. Second best...the Stacy roll.  Everyone i had, in the many times I have been there, are great. The fish is so fresh, the roll is perfectly built, the sauces are spot on.  It is a miracle they do this for all you can eat.  They even do substitutions!!! I listened to a person ask to have a Stacy roll with cream cheese...and they did it! The salmon roe is excellent and the sashimi is very good as well...because the fish, and i can't say this enough...is so fresh, so tasty, that anything that is made with this kind of care is going to be good. \n\nThe tempura is perfect in the roll, out of the roll...and most importantly...for the soft shell crab. The soft shell crabs are included and they are great...you would think perfect...OH NO...not until you get the Charlie handroll.  The Charlie is the single greatest roll in all of Las Vegas...and the best I have ever had. People who come from NYC, Philly and other major cities have sat in silence with me and ate bite after bite in sheer amazement. The crab is crunchy. The sauce is creamy and spicy. It is the single best thing I have had in my mouth since the time I met Emma Stone. \n\nAmazing service. Great people. The sushi chef is helpful and funny. The free refills of soda keep coming. The drinks are made strong and good! \n\nThe menu is full and very little isn't included. Much more than most all you can eat sushi joints.\n\nGo. Eat. Think of Asia. Think of Rex.

My 18 yr old Autistic daughter, was in the public school system through 10th grade, (Bad year, the kids were nice; some teachers were unbelievable) .  We needed a different education.  We found PS.

{"review_id": "6_324", "text": "I recently had a minor damage done to the lower section of the driver-side of my Accord bumper courtesy of a curbside wall \"invisible\" to my vision as I approached the parking pad. Great!. I left a significant dent to it as well as a pretty-good scrape to the paint. The dent measured about 5 inches in diameter. I also had a very small indentation on the car hood that was made from an unknown source. Just a dent (2 inches) and no paint issues. \n\nI received three quotes from three traditional auto body shops in the Toronto area including one recommended by my car mechanic of 30 years. They were all able to give estimates that were very similar ($1500-$1800) that would take about 15-18 hours to repair the damages.  As a consumer, I could not understand why the estimates were so high and so much time was required. Yes, the bumper needed to be removed to be repainted. But having to replace all of the bolts, screws, etc.? \n\nSo, I took a look at the industry where there was innovation. I found two companies, DentDoctor and AutoDent. DentDoctor (Leaside) said they could fix the bumper dent ($150) but couldn't do the work on the hood or repaint the bumper. They recommended that the work done at an autobody shop. \n\nAutoDent said no problem, $600 and done in two days. Marty (owner) and Alex were true to their word. Incredible craftsmanship. My wife was shocked at how beautiful the work was and how new the car looked.\n\nA minor car dent repair with inflated prices from the traditional auto body companies explains a great deal why insurance companies are stuck with increasing insurance premiums. \n\nAutoDent is great and worth every Loonie or Twoonie!", "stars": 5.0}

{"review_id": "6_331", "text": "Our 1999 Chrysler 300m needed paint BAD!  It only has 55,000 miles and except for a few minor door dings and a nasty case of the clear coat deteriorating on the roof and trunk paint it was certainly not in need of replacing. No way could we replace it with anything even close to comparable without easlily spending 5 figures.  But it did look terrible with big patches of paint missing, making it embarrassing to drive anywhere nice, and the valets were a whole other story.  \n\nSo I decided to get a few quotes for a new paint job. I first contacted a well known heavily advertised auto repair shop.  They came back with a quote of $4,000! (more if I wanted a color change) I was shocked.  I tried another and they said they could repaint the roof and deck lid and give it a polish job on the rest for $800. That sounded better but I wanted a full paint job. I decided to live with it a bit longer.\n\nOne day I decided to get a quote from one of the quickie paint shops.  I was very hesitant as I like quality work and I hate to have to complain and be unhappy because someone does a bad job. I went straight to Yelp and read a 5 star review and thought OK lets give it a shot.  I went ahead and drove to the 1 day Paint and Body shop on Spring Mountain, parked in the estimate slots and went inside where I was met by a very affable and charming sales guy.  Ok, here it comes I thought.  We went outside he looked the car over and pointed out some things I might want to repair and then wrote me up and estimate. He said they had a special if I did it that week that would save me $60 or so and handed me the estimate.  I was expecting to get pushed into the top of the line $1200 job that I saw on their wall price list.  Instead it was for $650 total!... include fixing four dour dings and a little body dent.  Wow! I thought! so I quizzed him about the paint quality and he said that was with a 3 year warranty for peeling, blistering, fading and that it was the exact factory color to match my cars original paint and they would need the care for 2-3 days. (that one day is just the name and to do a good job they need 2-3)  I thanked him and went home to discuss it with my wife. (but I knew I was sold)\n\nMy wife was surprised as well and we decided absolutely! It certainly could not look worse than it did at that time. So I took it in.  The next morning I realized I had left my keys in the car and went down to see if I could get them.  Joe, the same person who had gave me the quote took me right back to my car as he wanted anyhow to point out that a medallion I wanted removed would leave a big hole that would need to be filled.  I told him no leave the medallion in that case.  My keys were right where I left them.  The car was already pretty much prepped and looked to be ready for masking.  Once again I was impressed with the service.\n\n3 days later, actually the morning of the fourth day as it was over the 4th of July we were able to pick up the care.  We were amazed at how beautiful it looked! The paint color is a anthracite metallic charcoal - and it never looked more beautiful.  I swear it looked better and more metallic than when it was new.  No drips, run runs, no noticeable orange peel.  The car looks like new!  I'm an old \"car guy\" and I was surprised that I was so satisfied.\n\nOnce I got home I did find one spot on a door post where there was a very small masking issue.  I went in a few days later and asked if they could fix it.  I expected to get a bit of \"touch-up\" paint to fix it myself, however without hesitation Joe gave me an appointment to bring it back in once the paint has cured and they will remask and re-shoot the one door pillar.\n\nI cannot emphasize how pleased (and surprised) I am with the price, the result and the service.  I highly recommend them.", "stars": 5.0}

{"review_id": "6_342", "text": "I can't say enough good things about this store and its awesome crew!  \n\nMy father and I had just left the Verizon corporate store on S. Power Rd completely frustrated and confused after trying to upgrade his 3-year old plan and phone when we were fortunate enough to stumble on this GoWireless store!\n\nThe corporate store was less than helpful.  The corporate employees were very impatient and short with us, refused to take the time to explain anything to my father, who is very analytical, and did everything they could to pressure my dad into a more expensive, high-data plan without explaining how he might benefit from it.  After all, he only averages 0.3GB of data per month!  Our questions were met with sales pitches and simple \"no can do\" answers without offering alternatives.  Somehow, the first associate we spoke with got on the topic of tablets and data plans, while my father and I were still unclear about what to do with his phone.  All in all, there was simply no eagerness of the staff to really assist us as people and it became clear why the corporate store has you \"take a number\" when you come in.\n\nYet, just one day before our very disappointing experience with the corporate store, I had visited a GoWireless Verizon retail location in Scottsdale when I convinced my sister and her fiance to upgrade their phones while we were out at lunch together.  That was the first time I had ever heard of a \"GoWireless\" Verizon location and, although not a Verizon customer myself, I was impressed with the attention and service they received from the staff there.  One of the associates at the Scottsdale store even drove across town to another location while we waited to get the phones we wanted because it was a popular new model and they were out of stock at that location.  I found the customer-oriented service refreshing and in stark contrast to what I observed at the Verizon corporate store!  \n\nSo, as my father and I left the corporate location the next day, ready to pull our hair out, \"GoWireless\" was the first thing that came to my mind.  I looked online and was surprised to find a location very close to us on N. Power Rd.  I drove my father up there and, to this day, we are very glad we made the trip.\n\nIt was evening when we arrived and close to closing time, but the staff was very inviting.  We were first assisted by Thomas, who was extremely helpful and took the time to not only write out the price breakdown of each plan in a way that my father could understand, but he also researched other plan changes that could actually benefit him based on his specific needs.  He even put a popular phone on hold for him, since it was the last one at this location and we would have to come back another day to finish the transaction.\n\nWhen we returned to the store a couple days later, Thomas was there, along with Terry, the store manager, and another associate.  All three were actively helping people and answering the phones.  It was quite busy, but the staff remained upbeat and cordial with everyone, including us.  \n\nWhen it was our turn, Thomas remembered who we were and took the time to go back over all the plan options with my father a second time, which put my father at ease.  After that, both Thomas and Terry again looked over the proposed changes in detail before submitting them to make sure they would best fit my dad's particular needs and ensure he was getting the best deal over the long run.  \n\nIn the end, my dad walked out with the new phone he wanted, a 25% savings on his monthly bill (without having to give up any services) and a big smile on his face!  I couldn't ask for anything more of a retail store, corporate or not.  \n\nIf I ever switch to Verizon (and my interaction with Thomas, Terry and the rest of the crew have me considering it), I will be sure to stop by this location again.\n\nGo here for your Verizon needs and avoid the corporate store hassles.

{"review_id": "6_345", "text": "First let me start by saying that every business owner is entitled to a bad day. Life can get to the best of us at any given time.\n\nUpon arriving at the shop, I noticed there were no customers. Peculiar. My son's car (an older 2000 BMW model) needed a new rear rubber differential mount according to a diagnosis received at a reputable, but very expensive repair shop.\n\nI gathered a wide range of quotes, including Reinhard's over-the-phone quote of $259, 50% less than the highest quote.  I felt comfortable with the $259 quote since I gave them all the details (year/make/model, diagnosis, etc). Furthermore, Reinhard's even stated that they would replace two additional rear bushings next to the bad rubber mount (parts, tax, and labor) for this reasonable price.\n\nAfter apologizing for arriving about an hour late I asked to see the condition of the part(s) before any work started.  No problem I was told.\n\nThe mechanic hoisted the car on a rack and showed me the broken part.  He wanted to replace three items (rubber mount and two bushings) since they were most likely in the same worn condition.   In addition, he walked under the front of the car and explained the two front control arm bushings also tend to go bad on this particular make of car.  He made a good case for the additional problems.  Knowing that I came to this shop to save money, I was not prepared to pay for additional repairs of course. The new quote was over $750!!  Somewhat stunned, I asked for the cost breakdown. The original $259 quote had ballooned to $550 for the originally diagnosed bad rubber mount.  I asked for a minute to make a phone call at that point. No problem they said. \n\nAfter the phone call, I politely stated that I was not prepared to spend that much money and that I'd have to come back another time.  The woman curtly stated, \"That will be $79.95\".  I asked what the charge was for and she stated it was a diagnosis fee. \"As soon as the car is put on the rack, it costs $79.95!  Everyone knows that!\", she exclaimed.  I implored that she should have mentioned that up front and that I was not looking for a diagnosis since we had already spoken over the phone about a quote for the work before hand.  The mechanic walked back in the office and said the work was much more involved than he predicted.  OK, I beg to differ.  The issue is a known problem with the type of vehicle my son owns and I had given them the details needed to know before-hand that the differential needed to be dropped in order to replace the rubber mount.\n\nThe woman again sternly stated that the charge is well-known by all her customers and that it was posted on the wall.  I asked to see the posting.  After pointing to several different posted pages (all printed in 11 pt font) we still could not find anything that informed customers of the $79.95 charge.  The woman was avoiding all eye contact at this point and I turned to the window to consider the situation.  I was about to offer to pay $40 since their time is not free when the woman yelled for the mechanic to drop the d*mn car from the rack and for me to get the \"F\" out of their shop and never come back.  All I could say was \"Wow, this is great customer service.\" The woman continued to rant at the top of her voice!  Fairly shocked at the turn of events, I did an about face to walk out of the shop to check on the car which was being hastily removed from the shop's open bay.  As the mechanic got out of the car I tried to sincerely thank him for his time but he looked away and stated, \"Don't talk to me!\"  At this point, I simply needed to get out of there.\n\nAbout  1/2 a block down the road, I began to become very suspicious that something vindictive could have been done to the car.  Sliced radiator hoses or cut serpentine belts came to mind.  Upon checking for leaking fluids and other obvious items, I could only find a missing cap that covers a multi-pin connector near the suspension mount.  I have no idea when that cap disappeared but I was glad to be done with Reinhard's German Autohaus!  While I will never recommend this business, it is entirely possible that my experience was an anomaly.  Unfortunately, there are only a few reviews posted for this shop.  Good luck!", "stars": 1.0}

And I thank God I did find Apex. Let me just say I get very nervous going to the dentist. Wasn't always so until 5 years ago.They said OK were going to get started and I started shaking uncontrollably, from then on I hated going to dentist but did so anyways because I take good care of my teeth. For some reason my teeth are very sensitive. The Dentist, Dr. Dominic Do from Able Dental would be surprised at how much they needed to be numbed up just for a teeth cleaning and I'm not kidding he would often have to stop and numb me up some more and then some more.The reason I would make an appointment was because my whole mouth hurt. Nothing was wrong so they would do a teeth cleaning and turns out that's what I needed a teeth cleaning. But on other occasions when I had a cavity or had to have a rootcanalI would Xanax up but again each time I went in for a cavity or rarely a root canal I would have to get numbed up like crazy and thank God Dr. Do or his assistant would numb me up no matter how much I asked for it. I went to another Dr. Office one time and he was getting pist off at me (freaking jerk)But on to Apex and Eddie Tai,DMD and their very friendly staff. I was nervous for about 2 weeks And I told them their going to have to numb me like crazy. And they said yes you will be numbed up real good but I didn't believe him one bit. So on the day of my appointment i took my Xanax so I wouldn't shake and when Dr. Eddie numbed me up. Let me tell you I didn't feel a thing, not the needle, not the drilling. Oh the reason I went there to begin with was because I had an absess.But I just wanted to THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART FOR NOT CAUSING ME ANY PAIN. I was so happy but I could see your very busy and I wanted to thank you my daughter said there's an APP called YELP that can let you give reviews and since your a busy man along with a busy staff I just wanted to let you know I appreciate all that you did for me and for not lying to me when you said I wouldn't feel pain.

{"review_id": "6_359", "text": "Proof...You Can Teach a 10 Yr. Old Dog New Tricks\n\nMax was a very protective and aggressive Maltese with people and animals of all kinds. He would bark, attack, and act like a fish on the end of a line of his leash when he saw any other people or dogs on a walk. He also watched TV and would bark at any animal he saw. This behavior was nothing but a cycle of chaos, embarrassment, helplessness for 10 long years. We had tried several dog trainers and had even followed all recommendations on the dog training TV shows, but still had no success.  \n\nWe had resigned to the fact that Max was going to be an indoor dog only and would always be crated when friends came to visit.  This was such a sad thought because, Max loves walking and is, underneath all the fear, a very social dog.  So, living only inside and isolated was boring and not any quality of life for him.\n\nThen, hope showed up...Greg and Katrina from Uber Dog drove up one day while we were outside eating lunch.  Seeing his green car around several times before, I felt it was a synchronistic event for him to pull up right in front of us and sit right beside us for lunch.  Well, my curiosity got the best of me and I had to ask them about their training.\n\nBeing quite sure they had nothing new to offer and that I wasn't going to plop down more money on a new training method that I was quite sure wouldn't work for \"OUR DOG\"...since we had tried so many times before.\n\nHowever, because of liking them so much and their confidence that I could get results, I found myself making an appointment for a FREE in-house training for the very next week.  I did have a small glimmer of hope that maybe this could work, but really I had much more cynicism and skepticism that it wouldn't.\n\nBut after our first free session with Greg, I was feeling a little more confident that Max \"might,\" just \"might,\" get some results.  \n\nThen came the moment of truth.  Would I take that small, very small hope, and spend my money (which I didn't feel I had) on Max AGAIN? Yet we did, still with a great deal hesitancy.\n\nBUT it turned out to be one of the best leaps of faith we have ever taken!\n\nAfter the second session, we did get some results with Max, which was very exciting, and gave us just a little bit of confidence that there was a small glimmer of hope that he could change, just maybe.  Those first sessions made us feel that he wasn't broken, and neither were we.  Then, week after week, we kept getting results and every week we gained more confidence and so did Max. \n\nMax wasn't the perfect student and he resisted the collar/training at first, causing me to cave in with guilt and fear I was going to hurt him, but with some emotional support from Greg, we stuck with it and Max and I finally broke through and things started clicking for both of us. \n\nNow, after just a few times of in-house training and a few months of group sessions, we are walking with ease in the park \"like normal dogs and owners,\" we are walking him in Birkdale Village, and letting people and kids, and even DOGS, walk up to him and greet him with no negative reactions.  \n\nIt is a real breakthrough!!!!\n\nNo more leaving outings utterly embarrassed, frustrated and hopeless like we used to.  \n\nWe have gained our lives back. And our dog. We have order and control again...no more guilt for not being able to give Max the quality of life he deserves...no more blame and beating ourselves up for having such an out of control dog.  \n\nNow, I share Uber Dog with every dog owner I run into, who is looking for some kind of improvement, in hopes they will gain the quality of life we have for them and their furry friends. It has for me and my 10 year-old old dog.", "stars": 5.0}

They run his debit card from the 2nd institution where he has his money and BofA says it's too much and it won't process.  So he calls the other bank, we wait for about ten minutes and when he gets the larger amount approved to be run through his debit card, the teller at the window unapologetically tells us that because she already ran his card once she can't do it again.  Why didn't she tell us the precaution before she ran the card in the first place?  Or how about telling us after it was rejected once that she cannot run it another time and so don't waste 10 minutes of our time calling the other bank to get it approved?  So we run to my bank, Wells Fargo, which I have been a faithful member since age 16, and the process was so turnkey and friendly.

So after the amazing renovations, the hard work, and 5 years of building a clientele, they were forced out by an unscrupulous landlord who wanted to take over their business.  They also tried to poach all of their staff - sent them letters saying they would hire them and give them all raises.

I have great mechanical talent and have always serviced my own vehicles and know a great deal about engines and especially about my 2004 Suburban.  I have and understand all of the vehicle service manuals.  They are the \"bibles\" I refer to when ever there is an unusual issue with the car.\n\nWe have been using this location of Guerlichs (Store 18) for a little over five years to provide regular Maint and service on the Suburban since I no longer enjoy the \"get out and get under\" of vehicle care.  The vehicle has been well maintained and has just turned over to 134,900 miles.  Oil pressure is very good, the exhaust is clean and there is no evidence of unusual oil consumption.\n\nRecently we returned from a 2,000 mile trip that was uneventful until about 300 miles from home.  After refueling and upon startup the \"check engine light\" came on steady and stayed on.  We stopped to read the manual and concluded it was a minor malfunction in the emission control system.  The manual said it would be OK to continue to drive but it should be looked at within the next few days.  To be certain I called my Greulich's service writer and was told that it would be OK to continue to drive.  As long as the light was not flashing.\n\nEverything remained normal and we returned home, taking the car into Store 18 the next day.  We reported the \"steady check engine light\".  We were told they would look into it.\n\nLater in the day I received a phone call in which the service writer concluded the engine had been driven while very low on oil, was making noise and would require a major overhaul.  Returning to the shop I noticed that he had falsified the written service records to cover up the false diagnosis saying we reported observations about engine warning light and oil pressure that we did not report and the records contained a number of other errors.\n\nI demanded they release the car and I would verify the diagnosis.  The vehicle is OK, the oil level is OK, the engine makes no noise and the oil pressure is normal.\n\nWhen the suspected fraudulent behavior was reported to the Corporate Customer Service VP, his\" investigation\" allowed him to conclude the Service Writer was correct and the customer was wrong.  We have driven it another 4,000 miles with no evidence of oil consumption or any other problem.\n\nGreulich's store # 18 is no longer to be trusted.

{"review_id": "6_395", "text": "This is review as a buyer and as a seller and as comparing to Nellis Auction. As a buyer using the online Auction Zip I find consistently that online bids to McManus are always the maximum bid but at Nellis Auctions I won a lot with bid below my maximum bid never at McManus strange. I challenge someone to defy this. There is only 3% difference in bidding online versus in person and no $100 cash requirement. As a seller if you are close with Patrick McManus and his staff your merchandise gets favorable advertising for example bring in stack of records. The staff can choose to highlight records or songs people are familiar with higher chance bigger  bid on the lot or you can choose those records and songs not familiar thus lowering the bids on the lot. Also quality of the merchandise antiques seem to be all weathered like sitting outside and constant lots of Nazi regalia. Compare the auctioneer with Nellis you will find differences seems like Patrick may have been used car sales person will tell you anything to buy, Nellis more honest truthful and down to earth.", "stars": 1.0}

{"review_id": "6_399", "text": "My husband and I recently became new home owners and are extremely excited about having a pool.   We want to maintain it ourselves so we were pleased to see a pool service company to offer a \"Pool School\". I called Gilbert Pool Service to arrange the service and spoke to someone very knowledgeable and friendly over the phone.   Originally set up our appointment for after 5pm since that's the time my husband would be home.   The technician called me that day and had explained he was unable to accommodate our time slot so we set it up for Saturday between 9-11.  I work nights and woke up at 1230 to find my husband telling me the pool guy never showed.   I found the technician's phone number in my phone and called at 1241. He answered. I asked if the pool school we arranged between 9 and 11 was still happening. He didn't provide me with an excuse with why the service was delayed.   He just responded with \"I can be there in 15 minutes.\"  I spoke to him at 1241 he arrived at 117.  More than 15 mins.   I look forward to contacting the company about this matter on Monday.  I was debating on giving the company no stars, but thought that wouldn't be fair since the technician actually showed up. \n \n Reading a few other reviews, I see that the company actually reads it's reviews since they respond to them.   That's awesome. It tells me the company is open to feed back. With that being said maybe they will read mine..... \n\nIf they do....  I feel like our  time is valuable... Especially our personal time away from our careers. I work nights and my husband only has a few days off a month.  Since your company has complete disregard for personal time, I don't think we will be using your services if having pool issues  from here on out.", "stars": 1.0}
{"review_id": "6_400", "text": "When I decided to buy a new car, I knew that my first step was to get pre-approved for a loan. I scoured the Internet to find the bank or credit union that was offering the lowest rate. If you've recently purchased a car, then you'll know how terrible rates are right now. I visited Deer Valley Credit Union's web page and saw that they were offering rates as low as 5.5% (based on credit, term, LTV, etc...). Since that was the lowest rate I could find, I decided to submit an application. \n\nI drove up to the location off the I-17, and submitted an application with Jennifer. She was very friendly and made the process very easy. Unfortunately, because I arrived so near to closing, a decision wouldn't be available until the next business day. \n\nWhen the decision came back, I was told that while I had a great credit score, my history was a little light for their guidelines, so I would need a cosigner. Not a problem, I happen to have two parents with phenomenal credit, and a robust history to back it up. My Dad called Jennifer and submitted his information with my application. She soon called back to let us know that we had been approved, and would need to stop by the branch to sign off on the loan. Unfortunately, that same day, my Dad suffered a detached retina, and was scheduled for an immediate surgery. This clearly left him unable to visit the branch with me, anytime soon to sign paperwork. \n\nShortly after, my Mom called Jennifer to replace my Dad on the application as my cosigner. She called back again to let us know that we had been approved, but since she was scheduled to leave early that day, we would have to close with someone else. I gave her our time frame, and she said she'd make sure to have the paperwork ready for us so that we would be in and out quickly. \n\nWhen we arrived at the branch, Jennifer unexpectedly greeted us in the lobby and told us that she had decided to stay late so she could make sure that everything was completed quickly and correctly. I was so impressed by her prompt service and attention to detail. She really made the whole application and closing process easy, and I'm so glad that I went to Deer Valley CU for my auto loan. \n\nUnfortunately, I can't vouch for any of the other employees or representatives (had minimal contact with anyone else); but if you're looking for financing, do yourself a favor and call Jennifer at Deer Valley.", "stars": 5.0}

{"review_id": "6_405", "text": "We were happy at the beginning of our business relationship. Salesperson Jonathan Kline was helpful in helping us with a rental when we were moving from out of state. We then cancelled the rental and decided to buy a home, so we decided to keep our loyalty with Jonathan since he had been helping us already. \nThe mortgage broker he referred us to seemed ok, he helped us through the pre-qual process, explained everything thoroughly and was very professional. Jonathan sent us listings regularly and as soon as we were in town took us on several house viewings. We were happy with Jonathan throughout most of the transaction. \nWe mentioned we were looking for a pool table when we were starting the rental process, the first day we met Jonathan. He told us that his dad had one he was trying to get rid of. When we made the decision to buy he told us he would give it to us, that we would have it as a house warming present delivered to our new home the day we close. We were thrilled and grateful for how generous he was. We made sure to get a home with the perfect space for it, confirming on several occasions this was still happening. We even confirmed with his father, Robert Kline (owning broker) during a signing at their office.\nOne of the final days prior to closing, I followed up with Jonathan on a few things. One being the pool table he promised. He told me at that time he would not be there the final days prior to closing, however his father and brother (Robert Kline Jr and Sr) would be there to assist us with the final aspects of closing. He said they both had pool tables, would show us a picture and we could pick them one we wanted. Come final walk thru, his dad was not there, only his brother. When we asked about it, he laughed and nonchalantly stated that he had one his brother was trying to get, but he obviously had no intention of giving it to us.  On closing day, the most important day of the transaction, none of them were there. A random kid (friend of theirs I guess) came to hand us keys.\nThe more we thought about how we were deceived with the promise of a pool table we did not get and an HVAC tech that did not correctly inspect the unit and reported incorrectly, the more we thought about what else we were lied to about.\nDuring the entire process Jonathan indicated that our closing costs would be covered by our $5k seller credit, this was not the case.\nHe promised that they would increase our home warranty coverage to their recommended $1k after closing. This was not the case.\nWe feel we were deceived by Arizona Elite Properties, Jonathan and his family. We regret not doing business with a more reputable company for the most important transaction in our lives. \nI tried to follow up with Jonathan multiple times afterwards, only to hear lame excuses and then silence.\nWe will never make that mistake again!

Although my husband is still switching our main checking account to a different bank, of the years we have been with CCCU it has been fabulous up until the new system change. \n\nThank you for the long time services you have provided us CCCU. \n*******************************\nWe have been long long long time customers of CCCU. We have noticed in the last year that both our debit cards have been compromised much more frequently which was alarming. We have never experienced our debit card being compromised BEFORE we even received the card in the mail. After speaking to the representative, we learned the card never made it to our mailbox yet and somehow was comprised yet again. \n\nThen a few months later we learned the bank would be closing completely to switch systems. This is a bit ridiculous. Closing the actual for 4 days to learn a system I suppose is one thing but to have no access to own online account for 4 days?!?! That's absolutely ridiculous. Whether you asked permission or not. \n\nThen we have a charge show up on our account for $-6.68 and the description says Sam's Club from 8/2/18. When I called no one can tell me exactly what it means because that date was before the new system. \n\nWhen we have thousands coming in from my husbands current job and from his military pensions we cant risk not having access to our money or access to our online account. And furthermore we cant keep our money in a bank where we cant trust our money will be there. I went today to withdraw majority of our checking and savings and will continue to withdraw until after the first until we have nothing left and then close the accounts. While in line for over an hour I happen to talk to 2 individuals and they said they cant stand the new system. They also said they have stood in line for over 2 hours since the new system. Whoever thought the new system was going to benefit CCCU was clearly sold on a wrong deal. It's a sad day because we have been with CCCU since before my husband joined the military so that was 2002.", "stars": 5.0}

{"review_id": "6_425", "text": "This review is in response to Allen B posted on Feb 9, 2018. I hope the manager of this hotel reads this review.\n\nI was a delayed West Jet passenger on Friday night and also waited at the airport for the hotel shuttle to pick myself and many other guests up and transport us to the hotel. I had called the hotel directly and upon asking when the arrival would be was clearly told that due to weather, road conditions and the large number of delayed airline passengers coming to the hotel that it would be there as soon as possible, as safe as possible. I stayed inside the terminal waiting and constantly would pop out to take a look rather than be foolish and stay outside in the cold temperatures. No person, hotel staff or otherwise has control of the weather and the wicked conditions of the roads in Toronto on a stormy winter night. Once the shuttle arrived we all loaded in and was driven safely to the hotel. \n\nThe check-in process took a few moments because of the volume of people and the staff appeared to be handling it with ease. I had no problems waiting in line until I became witness to a rude person who started berating the staff because he is some 'member'. There is a lovely bar and restaurant in the lobby area so it would have been easy to have a seat and grab a drink and wait for the lines to diminish however I chose to wait in line as I just wanted to get some pizza and relax in a comfortable bed. \n\nAs for this manager having her dinner break, I did witness a food delivery being made and the manager pick it up, however it was done away from the front desks in front of a coffee counter and taken to what I assume is a staff room of some sort down a hallway near the elevators. Being delivery I can only assume it was placed earlier in the evening as wait time for outside food delivery was lengthy due to the nasty weather and road conditions. (my pizza and wings took over an hour to arrive from Pizza Nova) There is no way this manager Kim could have predicted what was going to happen nor is she not allowed to have a break and eat at work. Regardless if we interrupted her break or not, she was kind and professional enough to leave her break and speak with this ignorant person, something not everyone would do.   \n\nI find the the review from Allen B. is a personal attack on this manager Kim as was his attitude Friday night in the hotel. It was awkward and embarrassing to witness and I truly felt bad for the manager Kim and the staff in the hotel. She must have handled idiots like this in the past as she did not skip a beat nor let his rudeness stop her from being professional throughout the entire exchange. Kudos to whomever trained her as I was ready to throw this idiot into a snowbank myself.  \n\nPeople like Allen B. disgust me as they probably have never worked a customer service job in their life. He has no right to comment on the mangers facial expressions as the only sourness in the hotel that night was coming from him. Once it was my moment to register it was handled quickly and professionally. I don't think it would have mattered if it was the manager Kim or the Queen of England herself who had to help this person, he was never going to be satisfied. (Actually if you review his yelp reviews he is never satisfied) \n\nMy one night stay was pleasant and the staff were trying their very best. The weather was terrible but everyone was taking it in stride as best as they could. I would absolutely stay at this hotel again because of the way the staff handled this situation. To remain cool and calm under such nasty pressure is a true testament to this hotel and the management team they have hired to lead this hotel. \n\nKudos to you all. \n\nNote: This was my first stay at the Westin Airport Hotel but it will not be the last.

{"review_id": "6_430", "text": "Recently purchased a new place in Blakeney, so had the pleasure of embarking on the nerve-wracking search for a painter to completely change the entire color scheme in the home, because isn't that what we all pretty much do when we buy a new house?  I mean, who wants to live in a house with someone else's colors on the wall, so there is something strangely refreshing about defining the space as my own by spending a couple thousand dollars to totally overhaul the interior paint job, room by room...pure insanity I know, but that is beside the point LOL.\n\nI call the search nerve-wracking, because finding a good painter is like finding that ideal match on an online dating site. The search seems to go on with no end in sight and just when you think you have found the right one, you get the carpet pulled right from under your feet and then have the defining moment where you have to either get back in the game and try again or decide to go it alone...wait, we are still talking painting right haha.  Ok, back to our regularly scheduled program...\n\nAfter interviewing countless numbers of painters, I finally decided to give Ben Hamrick of Ronald's painting a shot at the job.  For me, selecting a painter is not about finding the cheapest guy, as anyone can do a job cheaply, but considering that our homes are usually our biggest investment, why would we want someone who offers to do a job for the lowest price, as far too often, you get what you pay for, especially when it comes to service providers such as painters, contractors, etc\n\nBen came to my home on time, (which is a HUGE plus for me) and offered a detailed estimate with a fair price and more importantly, took the time to thoroughly explain the work that would be involved, the products that would be used, the start and end date, etc.  He wasn't the highest or the lowest estimate, but he was the most detail oriented and customer centric of the entire bunch, as everything was about making sure he would be able to meet my needs and expectations, and he made it very clear that no payment would be expected until I was 100% satisfied with the work.  \n\nThis was a very important selling point for me, as it not only demonstrated the confidence he had in his work, but also put me in a position of having 0% liability from a financial standpoint, which of course helped ease the skepticism that usually occurs when I am dealing with various service providers as you always hear the horror stories of people running off with your money leaving your house in disarray, but Ben's policy of no money upfront or upon completion until I am 100% satisfied, completely eliminated that issue and put me at ease.\n\nThe actual work order involved painting the entire downstairs, including the kitchen, great room, dining room, bathroom, and two story entry foyer.  I also had him do 2 bedrooms upstairs and the master bath.  The actual cost of the project was more than reasonable and by working directly with Ben, he was able to offer me an additional discount that made him the right choice both from a customer service and financial standpoint. \n\nBased on past experience, I was expecting the job to take 4 or 5 days and had already mentally prepared myself for total disruption over the course of the next week, but to my complete and utter surprise, the job was started at 8am on a Friday and completed by Saturday evening.  Instead of just bailing on Saturday at 5pm and coming back on Monday to finish the job, the guys were very diligent and took the extra time on Saturday to complete the job, including cleaning my entire home, disposing of all trash, and leaving my home looking better than it did when they first arrived the previous day.  \n\nThe overall quality of the work was excellent and I was thoroughly satisfied with how amazing the home looked upon completion.  To demonstrate Ben's commitment to customer service, one example of his going above and beyond was illustrated by the fact that when he noticed a stain on the ceiling in one of the bedrooms, he took the initiative to go up into the attic where he spotted a potential leak in the condensation line of the A/C unit.  \n\nTalk about going above and beyond..literally!  He didn't have to do this and could have very easily just painted over the stain and called it a day, but he took the extra step of checking out the stain and then giving me a heads up about it, potentially saving me hundreds of dollars in repairs down the road if I had never become aware of the issue until it was too late.  It is very rare to see this kind of service in today's day and age, so it is without hesitation that I give a ringing endorsement to Ben Hamrick of Ronald's Painting (direct business line 704-451-5245).\n \nIf you are looking for a worry-free painting experience at a fair cost and tremendous value, with excellent customer service from start to finish, Ben is definitely your man!", "stars": 5.0}

{"review_id": "6_440", "text": "This is gonna be one of those, \"good news, bad news\" reviews.  It does turn out well but there are twists and turns...\n \nI've eaten at Sonic's over the years, good food most of the time, but honestly, what are the expectations at a Sonic at 3am?  They're not often all than high.  \n\nAbout 3 years ago, driving \u00dcber, I found myself at a the Sonic very near Luke Air Force Base, west of Phoenix, around mid-morning.  And, you know, there is something exhilarating, exciting, liberating about realizing that eating a Double Cheeseburger at 10am is a good idea.  It isn't, and it is.  Yes!  To me, this happens like once every 2 years, so I was excited.  And on this day I did it!\n \nService was ok, burger, good.  Good, not great.  Not that hot, a good 10 am burger but now that I have a recent \"hot\" reference, it just wasn't that hot.  \n\nHere's the real problem from that day: the fries were fried in oil THAT WAS OLD.  TOO OLD.  Old enough that it made me sick. Not food poisoning-sick, not \"bad oysters\" sick, but sick.  And quite frankly, I've never gotten over it.  Stuck in my mind.  In fact, I have NEVER been able to drive in again to a Sonic, and say, \"Oh, I'm sure this will be better\".  Hell, I don't know that and I don't want to be made sick again.  Too many other burger options.  Even McDonald's at high-noon is far better because I know the fries will be ok.\n \nHere's a part of the story that's really SONIC-unbelievable: after \"recovering\" the next day from my feeling poor, I called the store, asked for the manager, told him what had happened.  He told me, specifically, and I quote, \"...uh, yeah, I 'thought' about replacing the grease that morning but didn't\".  Wait, wait?\n\nHonestly, I thought proper food service - you know, supervised by the County Health they would supervise proper FOOD SERVICE - but it did not work that way!  Create a maintenance schedule.  For a major chain restaurant?  \"you thought you might conduct maintenance....?\"  Sheesh.\n \nSo, it's been a longtime.  I Would Not Go Back.  And why would I?  Got a burger joint every 5 feet, walking or driving. But, for whatever reason, I found myself at 43rd Avenue and Peoria last week and really wanted a hot double cheese.  No fries, more like mid-afternoon, but I want a double cheese and my nav tells me this is a choice of one.  At least, for that moment.  So I order a double cheese, and for whatever reason, I asked for ketchup and onions only.  Sue me.  What I felt like.\n\nThis double cheese came out as hot -- heat-hot -- as any burger I've ever ordered or cooked.  And, but for the fact that the burger came with EVERYTHING ON IT, not just ketchup and onions, it was delicious.  But I called back on the speaker, said, it's great, really great, but I can't get past 4 or 5 toppings I didn't order.  One or two, maybe, but not lettuce, tomato, pickles...so, they made it again.\n\nNot only did Sonic make the burger again, the nice day-time manager brought the new version out to me with a future lemonade make-good, to be used for another day.  The second burger was not as hot, or as good as the first, but it was still pretty damned good.\n\nYou eat the fries.  I'll eat the double cheese. Oh, and pump up the size of the type in the menu. My eyesight is fine, hop-service menu is too small.", "stars": 5.0}

{"review_id": "6_444", "text": "I purchased a Groupon to have photos of my child done. I called Stephanie to get everything setup, she was great about explaining her process, her props, outfit decisions I should make for my child and to ensure any questions I had were answered. I felt the conversation was great, however at the end she did mention that tax and tip were not included in the purchase of the Groupon. I was absolutely fine paying the tax, however I was a little taken aback that she mentioned anything about a tip, as it is obvious that she is the proprietor of the business and I felt it was common knowledge that you don't tip the proprietor of a business. \n\nI arrived at Stephanie's home that day with my child and all of their outfits. The porch of her home is adorably decorated and very welcoming. As we were walking in her husband was coming down the stairs in his sweatpants and Stephanie was standing there with her hair wet. I felt that I was essentially intruding in on them. She had me sit in her office which was very nicely decorated and displayed some of the photos she has taken. She went over the contract with me and explained that I will not own the rights to the photos. She took the time to go over what that means and made it a point to say, So what this is means is that if your child becomes president, I'll be selling these photos to TMZ. Now, I'm a fairly intelligent individual, so I felt this analogy and the fact that she felt that was an appropriate statement to make was tacky. I did sign the release, I wish I hadn't and I wish I left at that point, but I didn't and that was on me. \n\nAfter the paperwork was squared away we started talking props and backgrounds. She has so many props to choose from, which is nice. Once we had decided on everything we talked outfits for my child. When it came time to do outfit changes, I would not put my child down on their carpet, it was absolutely filthy. Their kitchen had food on the floor and overall while the home was picked up it was dirty. I get it, they have kids, but they're also running a business out of their home, so I'm sorry but these are factors. \n\nI was uncomfortable by how much Stephanie and her husband argued during the entire process. Once again, I should have left at this point, but I didn't. They argued about backdrops, they argued about the settings of her camera, it was incredibly uncomfortable. Her husband attempted to assist with getting my child to laugh and smile, but between him constantly making sounds and calling their name, Stephanie trying to get their attention and then me standing there you could tell my child wasn't feeling it. I did bring this up to them, that is was just too much and she suggested that I go sit in the office. I said no. I didn't feel comfortable and suggested her husband needed to take a break because I could tell my child was overwhelmed. I could tell they felt insulted, but oh well. I would also like to state, I'm not a helicopter parent, I don't hover so I don't feel that my presence was doing any harm. \n\nStephanie felt she got some good shots and I could tell my child was done before the session was over so we called it done. They had the photos sent to me to proof in a very timely manner. I was very sad about how they turned out and I did convey via email that I felt there wasn't much to choose from. I think it was a combination of factors. I think it was just the icing on the cake that I went through all of this and then the photos were worse than photos I have taken on my own on my iphone. \n\nI really do think Stephanie is doing the best she can, and you can see this is a business she is incredibly passionate about and I admire that. But for myself and my child, it was a miss. That's not to say that others haven't had wonderful experiences and that others won't have wonderful experiences. It's just that for our family, it didn't work out and I wouldn't use or recommend her to my friends or family. I did end up hiring another photographer and the pictures did turn out wonderfully. So, you never know I guess. \n\nI did want to email Stephanie and provide this feedback to her directly, however in reflecting how the shoot went it was my opinion that I didn't feel she would have been receptive to my feedback.", "stars": 1.0}

{"review_id": "6_449", "text": "I attended Rio from 2007 to 2010 and completed an Associate of Arts with them. I feel compelled to submit a review because I was surprised at the number of poor reviews listed. Many of the complaints about administrative staff and associated issues are (unfortunately) very common in just about every college/university. I've worked professionally in higher ed since 2007 and currently work for a reputable university in the area of Boston, MA, where our administrative issues are (in my experience) worse than or about as bad as any experience I had with Rio's administration.  With any school, the student, unfortunately, has to keep immaculate records and stay on the administrative folks in order to take care of their needs and has to make a concerted effort to self-educate about deadlines, etc. I wish that were different. I believe that as of approximately 2014, Rio is working on an improved student advising program, which might help to alleviate this problem. \n\nI can't speak for the current state of things at Rio since I graduated four years ago, but I can say that by putting in a lot of time and effort,  I was granted a transformative educational experience. I obtained a solid foundation for my education and have plans to continue in school up through a master's or PhD. \n\nMy experiences with Rio made up for a deficient high school education, which was important to me. Also, I am currently pursuing my bachelor's with a university in Boston, and they accepted almost all of my Rio credits toward their program, and they aren't even one of Rio's partner schools. The credits that weren't accepted were because I over-fulfilled a requirement and didn't have anywhere else to claim the credits in their program, not because the courses did not meet their academic standards. \n\nAnother positive comment is that we had a beautiful graduation ceremony at the Orpheum Theater. Our speakers were, like me, granted life changing experiences by Rio. One thing they do that I appreciate is they offer print-based courses to those in prison.\n\nTIPS: \nKeep a copy of every document you submit and a log of phone calls and names of those you have spoken with as well as what they promised you and by when. Follow up. \n\nStay away from the accelerated courses! It's too much work in too short a time frame. \n\nCarefully review their system requirements before signing up for classes.\n\nTake advantage of their vast online library!! I still use it as an alum several years later!\n\nYou can get your entire Rio degree AND books paid for by the Pell grant if you qualify. My AA resulted in $0 debt. If you have financial aid, take advantage of the book waiver program where your books are billed to your financial aid account so you have them day 1 of class without paying.\n\nThe idea behind those Rio-only books is that they were made to save you money because they are far cheaper than most textbooks.

Cab comes and picks up passenger. \n\nI would give classy Cab an A+ at step 1. They masterfully answered my phone call within 5 rings. They demonstrated great skill in the first step. \n\nStep 2- They said that a cab will be there to pick me up at my desired location within 10 minutes (mind you this is a cold winter day with wind chill temperatures in the sub 0 range). I say great and hang up the phone. \n\nAt this point I am fairly excited to quickly or at least somewhat quickly get out of the cold outside. \n\n10 minutes goes by... No Cab.... 15 minutes goes by.... No cab.... Uh oh, step 3 is running 5 minutes late.\n\nNo big deal, i'll just give them another call, maybe something got lost between step 2 and 3 and a phone call can quickly fix it. \n\nAgain, they nailed step 1 totally answered my phone call, and then assured me that the cab would be there any minute.  \"it is in the area and dispatched.\" I thank them again. \n\nBy this point my fingers are getting so cold it is difficult to operate phone but I am still excited to get out of the cold and get to my destination...\n\n10 more minutes goes by (25 minutes into the \"10 minute wait\") I call back again. The operator assures me that cab will be there any second. I have no gloves no hat, maybe I should start walking\n\nMy destination is only 3 or 4 miles away, I start thinking of alternative ways to get myself out of the cold...\n\nI walk half a block to the nearest gas station to head inside for shelter...

I decide that since this place is keeping me warm, I should probably buy something so I can attempt to keep some shred of dignity. I walk around the store find a nice ice tea that I don't want to buy, take it up to the register and apologize for my actions\n\nAt this point the awesome worker takes pity on me and agrees to drive me my 4 mile trip for $20...

{"review_id": "6_470", "text": "Well, stopped by Seven Sisters for the first time in a long while because I was craving their yogurt.  The place is closed, gone.   \n\nWhat a shame.   This was a real hidden treasure, the best frozen yogurt in the Valley by leaps & bounds.   None of the well-known yogurt stalwarts in Phoenix Metro could hold a candle to the premium quality and fantastic taste of Seven Sisters frozen yogurt.   They had even gotten Best in Phoenix prizes from publications, etc.   Yet Seven Sisters seems to have gone bust during the downturn, while others have remained.   Why?\n\nAssuming the cause wasn't due to some internal issue, here are my thoughts:\n\n1.  The number one mistake was not marketing themselves as a Frozen Yogurt place.   Seven Sisters presented itself as a chocolate & confectionary place, which happened to have some frozen yogurt in the back.   It should've been the other way around.   \n\nFrozen yogurt is highly marketable, while confectionary candies & chocolate....not so much.   These guys had an amazing product, but they didn't put it out in the forefront of their strategy & branding.   When's the last time a friend turned to you and said, \"hey, let's go buy some fancy chocolates?\".   No?  Yeah, I thought so.   But there have been thousands of times when friends tell me, \"wow, let's go have some frozen yogurt\", or \"hey, I want some ice cream or something.\"   When you search for Valley yogurt places, you see all the places that compete squarely on that turf - Golden Spoon, BerryGood, YogurtLand, etc.   The Froyo at Seven Sisters completely destroys all of these competitors, yet it was always hard to find if you were doing a quick search for a yogurt shop.   It wasn't frequently mentioned because Seven Sisters never really threw its hat into the Yogurt ring, despite having the best product.\n\nYogurt should've always been the marketable core of this business.  The key is that so many yogurt places are identical, literally.  I don't know if they use the same supplier and just re-brand themselves.   Yogurtland, Yogurlicious, Yogurtology - exact same thing.   Overly sweet, too.   No subtlety.  No tang.   \n\nEven the title, \"Seven Sisters Sweet Shop\" says, \"we sell candy\".  You could've been walking by, dying for a yogurt fix and not have known that you just needed to step inside.  Hell, look right here on Yelp....see the category?   It says \"candy stores\".   No mention of Frozen Yogurt, while lesser yogurt places are highly visible.\n\n2. Their location was a little out of the way, north of the 101, not easily accessible to crowds or non-locals.  It's the old mantra: location, location, location.  If a properly branded & marketed Seven Sisters would have opened somewhere closer to downtown Scottsdale, or some other hip place like Kierland, with high visibility, the fantastic product would've reached the masses.\n\n3.  It was a little pricey.   Personally, I don't mind paying for top quality, but until you've reached fame and critical mass, you can't have huge profit margins.\n\nAlas, no other frozen yogurt can touch Seven Sisters, so now I'm left with lukewarm subsitutes.   Too bad it went the way of the dodo.   Farewell....", "stars": 5.0}

Needless to say they had to delay traffic on the freeway so i could get my car to a safer place. DPS came to help me change my tire and he was shocked and furious at how bad the tires were. He was surprised i even made it two weeks on the tires and said they were a joke and should not have been put on my car. The tires that were sold to me were 9 and 8 years old. I went to Discount Tire and got two new tires and i kid you not, there was a guy there getting serviced who bought tires from Two Gringos and he has a messed up fender from having a blow out and his tires were sold to him at 12 years old. Anyway,  I gave the old tires to Two Gringos and they gladly gave me a refund no fuss or problems, which i was very grateful for!

The owner is so concerned with saving money on the electric bill that the gym is too hot.  He feels 69 is appropriate.  OSHA standards are 65-68.  The problem is he manually controls the temperature and has even put tape in front of the indicator so no one can see the temperature...obviously this has been an on going problem.  If he isn't at the gym, it is much hotter than his preferred 69 degrees.  At that point, you are allowed to open doors and turn on fans. There shouldn't be fans, and the customers shouldn't have to explain their uncomfortableness.  \n\nFor being a new gym, some of the equipment needs maintenance.  While the owner is cleaning the gym often, he is not maintaining the equipment.  \n\nUnkept equipment and hot temperature doesn't make for a great or even good gym.

{"review_id": "6_498", "text": "I have been a loyal customer at this place since they opened, a couple of years ago, as I live on campus at York and also work there, so for me, to walk here in the summer months is a breeze. The staff have always been nice to me and I usually come in for a manicure, shellac manicure, and have had acrylics applied once and removed twice. \n\nNow, to preface, I use an electric wheelchair. This means that my chair is a few inches higher than the chairs that they use in the spa. I also cannot transfer out of my chair. I have a plexiglass tray attached to my chair, which is easily removable so that I can go up to one of their manicure table and get my nails done. Indeed, this is what I have always done at every other salon I've ever gone to. Usually, there is a little bit of confusion and a few flummoxed expressions in the beginning, but once the staff realizes that it's not a big deal, they just do my nails. \n\nI've been growing my nails out for a couple of weeks now with the intention of getting gel overlays and an french airbrush. Today, around 6:30pm, I stopped by the salon and there were quite a few people waiting. I told one of the owners that I wanted gel overlays and he informed me that they were quite busy and to come back. To make things easier, I texted my attendants who happens to be living close by for the summer to ask her to come with me (incidentally, I pay $15 an hour for attendant care). We returned at the salon around 7:20 and the other owner, Helen, who does most of the gels and acrylics I believe, flat-out refused to service me. \n\nEven though I told her that I had brought someone and that I could take off my tray, and that this is what they do for me at every other nail salon, she just stared at me silently and told me that they could only do a regular manicure for me (for which I don't have to take off my tray). I explained everything to her again and asked one more time if she could do the gel overlays. After a loaded pause, she simply looked at me and said \"sorry, no\". \n\nI will never go back to this place again. I will recommend to all of my friends and colleagues never to go to this place either, and I will post a negative review about this discriminatory business on every website that I can find. This is Canada and it is 2012 and if I'm paying for my nails to be done, I should be able to get them done without being told \"sorry, no\" simply because they don't want to deal with whatever hassle they perceive it would be to service someone in a wheelchair. When will it cease to be acceptable for someone with my disability to be refused service?

I always try to support local business, and liked the owner's approach.\n\nThis week, with Memorial Day and all, sounded like a great week for some ribs, since I haven't had good ones in a while. I searched on Groupon to see if there were any deals since I had read about some people getting them on Yelp, and found one and bought it. Went on Saturday evening about 6:45 with a few other people. Never even knew where Brookline was, but always up for discovering new areas. We walked in and saw about 4 picnic-like tables and one was unoccupied which worked out just great. Right when I was about to sit down, a woman came over from behind the counter and told me they were out of ribs. Come again? They had a bunch of catering to do over the weekend and were out of ribs. It's like going to a pizza place ON ALL-ITALY WEEKEND and finding out they're out of crust. And ribs were what I'd been craving! I WILL give her credit for letting us know before we were actually situated. So we decided to stay since we had just driven 1/2 hour, and figured we could still get some barbecue (she said the pulled pork had just come out). \n\nI ordered a combo plate of pulled pork and brisket, and got yams and baked beans as sides. I'll give them props on their no corkage fee on the beers we brought too. When trays of food came out for two of our party including me, I would normally have waited until all the food arrived, but was told by the other two that we should start eating while it's hot. So I took a forkful of the pulled pork. I could easily have waited since there wasn't a scintilla of heat to it! I found this somewhat bizarre since the beans were mouth-burning hot (and delicious I might add) AND the pork \"had just come out.\" In any event, I moved on to the brisket, which was in slices instead of pulled. I cut off a piece and found that it too was not hot AND was awfully chewy. AND it didn't have an awful lot of flavor (same for the PP). The yams were fine, and after doctoring the meats with a mixture of their sauces, I was able to satisfy my hunger. I didn't send anything back because we had already been there for awhile and really didn't want anything microwaved.\n\nI am so glad I had the Groupon because it made the cost bearable. I don't think their prices are out of line if their food was good (or even available for that matter). But I was NOT impressed and will NOT be going back.
